“You can’t judge the value of a thing by looking only at costs. In many countries, more people die from hospital errors than religious wars, but no one accuses hospitals of being evil. Religious people are happier, they live longer, have fewer accidents, and stay out of trouble compared to nonreligious people. From society’s viewpoint, religion works.” 32

Don’t confuse flexibility with weakness. Don’t judge people by their mistakes; rather, judge them by how they respond to their mistakes. Remember that your physical appearance is for the benefit of others. Attend to your own basic needs first; otherwise you will not be useful to anyone else

Intuitions are valuable for all kinds of things, especially in the social domain: deciding if your girlfriend is cheating on you, perhaps, or whether a business partner is trustworthy. But for mathematical issues, or assessing causal relationships, intuitions are often completely wrong, because they rely on shortcuts which have arisen as handy ways to solve complex cognitive problems rapidly, but at a cost of inaccuracies, misfires and oversensitivity.

16. Einstein (following Schopenhauer) once made the same point: Honestly, I cannot understand what people mean when they talk about the freedom of the human will. I have a feeling, for instance, that I will something or other; but what relation this has with freedom I cannot understand at all. I feel that I will to light my pipe and I do it; but how can I connect this up with the idea of freedom? What is behind the act of willing to light the pipe? Another act of willing? Schopenhauer once said: Der Mensch kann was er will; er kann aber nicht wollen was er will (Man can do what he will but he cannot will what he wills).

When comparing mental states, the reality of human consciousness is a given. We need not understand how consciousness relates to the behavior of atoms to investigate how emotions like love, compassion, trust, greed, fear, and anger differ (and interact) in neurophysiological terms.

There are many factors that bias our judgment, including: arbitrary anchors on estimates of quantity, availability biases on estimates of frequency, insensitivity to the prior probability of outcomes, misconceptions of randomness, nonregressive predictions, insensitivity to sample size, illusory correlations, overconfidence, valuing of worthless evidence, hindsight bias, confirmation bias, biases based on ease of imaginability, as well as other nonnormative modes of thinking.

As Stanovich and West (2000) observe, what serves the genes does not necessarily advance the interests of the individual. We could also add that what serves the individual in one context may not serve him in another. The cognitive and emotional mechanisms that may (or may not) have optimized us for face-to-face conflict (and its resolution) have clearly not prepared us to negotiate conflicts waged from afar—whether with email or other long-range weaponry.

In fact, there are whole sections of the New Testament, like the Book of Revelation, that were long considered spurious, that were included in the Bible only after many centuries of neglect; and there are other books, like the Shepherd of Hermas, that were venerated as part of the Bible for hundreds of years only to be rejected finally as false scripture. Consequently, it is true to say that generations of Christians lived and died having been guided by scripture that is now deemed to be both mistaken and incomplete by the faithful. In fact, to this day, Roman Catholics and Protestants cannot agree on the full contents of the Bible. Needless to say, such a haphazard and all-too-human process of cobbling together the authoritative word of the Creator of the Universe seems a poor basis for believing that the miracles of Jesus actually occurred.

Natural selection does nothing even close to striving for intelligence. The process is driven by differences in the survival and reproduction rates of replicating organisms in a particular environment. Over time, the organisms acquire designs that adapt them for survival and reproduction in that environment, period; nothing pulls them in any direction other than success there and then.”

When scientists have thought about the pathways of the brain for the last hundred years or so, the typical image or model that comes to mind is that these pathways might resemble a bowl of spaghetti—separate pathways that have little particular spatial pattern in relation to one another. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we were able to investigate this question experimentally. And what we found was that rather than being haphazardly arranged or independent pathways, we find that all of the pathways of the brain taken together fit together in a single exceedingly simple structure. They basically look like a cube. They basically run in three perpendicular directions, and in each one of those three directions the pathways are highly parallel to each other and arranged in arrays. So, instead of independent spaghettis, we see that the connectivity of the brain is, in a sense, a single coherent structure.”

Although we experience the illusion of receiving high-resolution images from our eyes, what the optic nerve actually sends to the brain is just a series of outlines and clues about points of interest in our visual field. We then essentially hallucinate the world from cortical memories that interpret a series of movies with very low data rates that arrive in parallel channels.

As we have seen, it is not just a metaphor to state that there is information contained in our neocortex, and it is frightening to contemplate that none of this information is backed up today. There is, of course, one way in which we do back up some of the information in our brains—by writing it down. The ability to transfer at least some of our thinking to a medium that can outlast our biological bodies was a huge step forward, but a great deal of data in our brains continues to remain vulnerable.

Von Neumann was deeply aware of the increasing pace of progress and its profound implications for humanity’s future. A year after his death in 1957, fellow mathematician Stan Ulam quoted him as having said in the early 1950s that “the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life give the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.” This is the first known use of the word “singularity” in the context of human technological history.

But a posteriori, through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns.”19

Science has been effective at furthering our understanding of nature because the scientific ethos is based on three key principles: (1) follow the evidence wherever it leads; (2) if one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove that it is right; (3) the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one’s a priori beliefs, nor the beauty or elegance one ascribes to one’s theoretical models.

By nothing, I do not mean nothing, but rather nothing—in this case, the nothingness we normally call empty space. That is to say, if I take a region of space and get rid of everything within it—dust, gas, people, and even the radiation passing through, namely absolutely everything within that region—if the remaining empty space weighs something, then that would correspond to the existence of a cosmological term such as Einstein invented.

It is worth repeating the implications of this remarkable agreement more forcefully: Only in the first seconds of a hot Big Bang, with an initial abundance of protons and neutrons that would result in something very close to the observed density of matter in visible galaxies today, and a density of radiation that would leave a remnant that would correspond precisely to the observed intensity of the cosmic microwave background radiation today, would nuclear reactions occur that could produce precisely the abundance of light elements, hydrogen and deuterium, helium and lithium, that we infer to have comprised the basic building blocks of the stars that now fill the night sky.

This is what differentiates them from purely theological questions, which generally presume the answers up front. Indeed, I have challenged several theologians to provide evidence contradicting the premise that theology has made no contribution to knowledge in the past five hundred years at least, since the dawn of science. So far no one has provided a counterexample. The most I have ever gotten back was the query, “What do you mean by knowledge?” From an epistemological perspective this may be a thorny issue, but I maintain that, if there were a better alternative, someone would have presented it. Had I presented the same challenge to biologists, or psychologists, or historians, or astronomers, none of them would have been so flummoxed.

I remind you of the unique facet of a flat universe, at least on scales where it is dominated by matter in the form of galaxies, and where a Newtonian approximation remains valid: in a flat universe, and only in a flat universe, the average Newtonian gravitational energy of every object participating in the expansion is precisely zero.

This results in the second amazing implication of inflation, that small-density fluctuations in empty space due to the rules of quantum mechanics will later be responsible for all the structure we observe in the universe today. So we, and everything we see, result out of quantum fluctuations in what is essentially nothingness near the beginning of time, namely during the inflationary expansion.

To summarize then: the observation that the universe is flat and that the local Newtonian gravitational energy is essentially zero today is strongly suggestive that our universe arose though a process like that of inflation, a process whereby the energy of empty space (nothing) gets converted into the energy of something, during a time when the universe is driven closer and closer to being essentially exactly flat on all observable scales.

Theologians may speculate about angels on pinheads or whatever is the current equivalent. Physicists might seem to have their own angels and their own pinheads: quanta and quarks, “charm,” “strangeness,” and “spin.” But physicists can count their angels and can get it right to the nearest angel in a total of 10 billion: not an angel more, not an angel less. Science may be weird and incomprehensible—more weird and less comprehensible than any theology—but science works. It gets results. It can fly you to Saturn, slingshotting you around Venus and Jupiter on the way. We may not understand quantum theory (heaven knows, I don’t), but a theory that predicts the real world to ten decimal places cannot in any straightforward sense be wrong. Theology not only lacks decimal places: it lacks even the smallest hint of a connection with the real world.

Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish.

Can we reconcile the idea that copying errors are an essential prerequisite for evolution to occur, with the statement that natural selection favours high copying-fidelity? The answer is that although evolution may seem, in some vague sense, a ‘good thing’, especially since we are the product of it, nothing actually ‘wants’ to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it happening.

In the eye colour example just given, the person would actually have brown eyes: the instructions for making blue eyes would be ignored in the building of the body, though this does not stop them being passed on to future generations. A gene that is ignored in this way is called recessive. The opposite of a recessive gene is a dominant gene. The gene for brown eyes is dominant to the gene for blue eyes. A person has blue eyes only if both copies of the relevant page are unanimous in recommending blue eyes.

I have described the normal division of a cell into two new cells, each one receiving a complete copy of all 46 chromosomes. This normal cell division is called mitosis. But there is another kind of cell division called meiosis. This occurs only in the production of the sex cells; the sperms or eggs. Sperms and eggs are unique among our cells in that, instead of containing 46 chromosomes, they contain only 23.

The chance coming together, through crossing-over, of previously existing sub-units is the usual way for a new genetic unit to be formed. Another way—of great evolutionary importance even though it is rare—is called point mutation. A point mutation is an error corresponding to a single misprinted letter in a book. It is rare, but clearly the longer a genetic unit is, the more likely it is to be altered by a mutation somewhere along its length.

Conversely, what are the properties that instantly mark a gene out as a ‘bad’, short-lived one? There might be several such universal properties, but there is one that is particularly relevant to this book: at the gene level, altruism must be bad and selfishness good. This follows inexorably from our definitions of altruism and selfishness. Genes are competing directly with their alleles for survival, since their alleles in the gene pool are rivals for their slot on the chromosomes of future generations. Any gene that behaves in such a way as to increase its own survival chances in the gene pool at the expense of its alleles will, by definition, tautologously, tend to survive. The gene is the basic unit of selfishness.

With reservations, the gene pool plays the same role for the modern replicators as the primeval soup did for the original ones. Sex and chromosomal crossing-over have the effect of preserving the liquidity of the modern equivalent of the soup. Because of sex and crossing-over the gene pool is kept well stirred, and the genes partially shuffled. Evolution is the process by which some genes become more numerous and others less numerous in the gene pool.

If simulation is such a good idea, we might expect that survival machines would have discovered it first. After all, they invented many of the other techniques of human engineering long before we came on the scene: the focusing lens and the parabolic reflector, frequency analysis of sound waves, servo-control, sonar, buffer storage of incoming information, and countless others with long names, whose details don’t matter. What about simulation? Well, when you yourself have a difficult decision to make involving unknown quantities in the future, you do go in for a form of simulation. You imagine what would happen if you did each of the alternatives open to you. You set up a model in your head, not of everything in the world, but of the restricted set of entities which you think may be relevant. You may see them vividly in your mind’s eye, or you may see and manipulate stylized abstractions of them. In either case it is unlikely that somewhere laid out in your brain is an actual spatial model of the events you are imagining. But, just as in the computer, the details of how your brain represents its model of the world are less important than the fact that it is able to use it to predict possible events. Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error.

The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology. There is no reason to suppose that electronic computers are conscious when they simulate, although we have to admit that in the future they may become so. Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain’s simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.

As a first approximation I said that what makes a gene good is the ability to build efficient survival machines—bodies. We must now amend that statement. The gene pool will become an evolutionarily stable set of genes, defined as a gene pool that cannot be invaded by any new gene. Most new genes that arise, either by mutation or reassortment or immigration, are quickly penalized by natural selection: the evolutionarily stable set is restored. Occasionally a new gene does succeed in invading the set: it succeeds in spreading through the gene pool. There is a transitional period of instability, terminating in a new evolutionarily stable set—a little bit of evolution has occurred.

Our conclusion from this chapter is that individual parents practise family planning, but in the sense that they optimize their birth-rates rather than restrict them for public good. They try to maximize the number of surviving children that they have, and this means having neither too many babies nor too few. Genes that make an individual have too many babies tend not to persist in the gene pool, because children containing such genes tend not to survive to adulthood.

Since each sperm is so tiny, a male can afford to make many millions of them every day. This means he is potentially able to beget a very large number of children in a very short period of time, using different females. This is only possible because each new embryo is endowed with adequate food by the mother in each case. This therefore places a limit on the number of children a female can have, but the number of children a male can have is virtually unlimited. Female exploitation begins here.*

He suggests that the tails of birds of paradise and peacocks, the huge antlers of deer, and the other sexually-selected features which have always seemed paradoxical because they appear to be handicaps to their possessors, evolve precisely because they are handicaps. A male bird with a long and cumbersome tail is showing off to females that he is such a strong he-man that he can survive in spite of his tail. Think of a woman watching two men run a race.

Eggs are a relatively valuable resource, and therefore a female does not need to be so sexually attractive as a male does in order to ensure that her eggs are fertilized. A male is perfectly capable of siring all the children born to a large population of females. Even if a male has a short life because his gaudy tail attracts predators, or gets tangled in the bushes, he may have fathered a very large number of children before he dies. An unattractive or drab male may live even as long as a female, but he has few children, and his genes are not passed on.

Suicidal self-sacrifice therefore seldom evolves. But a worker bee never bears offspring of its own. All its efforts are directed to preserving its genes by caring for relatives other than its own offspring. The death of a single sterile worker bee is no more serious to its genes than is the shedding of a leaf in autumn to the genes of a tree. There is a

Ants have their own domestic animals as well as their crop plants. Aphids—greenfly and similar bugs—are highly specialized for sucking the juice out of plants. They pump the sap up out of the plants’ veins more efficiently than they subsequently digest it. The result is that they excrete a liquid that has had only some of its nutritious value extracted. Droplets of sugar-rich ‘honeydew’ pass out of the back end at a great rate, in some cases more than the insect’s own body-weight every hour. The honeydew normally rains down on to the ground—it may well have been the providential food known as ‘manna’ in the Old Testament. But ants of several species intercept it as soon as it leaves the bug. The ants ‘milk’ the aphids by stroking their hind-quarters with their feelers and legs.

Viruses consist of pure DNA (or a related self-replicating molecule) surrounded by a protein jacket. They are all parasitic. The suggestion is that they have evolved from ‘rebel’ genes who escaped, and now travel from body to body directly through the air, rather than via the more conventional vehicles—sperms and eggs. If this is true, we might just as well regard ourselves as colonies of viruses!

The first ten chapters of The Selfish Gene had concentrated exclusively on one kind of replicator, the gene. In discussing memes in the final chapter I was trying to make the case for replicators in general, and to show that genes were not the only members of that important class. Whether the milieu of human culture really does have what it takes to get a form of Darwinism going, I am not sure. But in any case that question is subsidiary to my concern. Chapter 11 will have succeeded if the reader closes the book with the feeling that DNA molecules are not the only entities that might form the basis for Darwinian evolution.

What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be rectified in the next. The ‘everlasting arms’ hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a doctor’s placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary.

Each individual has his own way of interpreting Darwin’s ideas. He probably learned them not from Darwin’s own writings, but from more recent authors. Much of what Darwin said is, in detail, wrong. Darwin if he read this book would scarcely recognize his own original theory in it, though I hope he would like the way I put it. Yet, in spite of all this, there is something, some essence of Darwinism, which is present in the head of every individual who understands the theory.

Suppose, for the sake of argument, it happened to be the case that marriage weakened the power of a priest to influence his flock, say because it occupied a large proportion of his time and attention. This has, indeed, been advanced as an official reason for the enforcement of celibacy among priests. If this were the case, it would follow that the meme for celibacy could have greater survival value than the meme for marriage. Of course, exactly the opposite would be true for A gene for celibacy. If a priest is a survival machine for memes, celibacy is a useful attribute to build into him. Celibacy is just a minor partner in a large complex of mutually-assisting religious memes.

All genes look alike, just as all recording tapes look alike. The important differences between genes emerge only in their effects. This usually means effects on the processes of embryonic development and hence on bodily form and behaviour. Successful genes are genes that, in the environment influenced by all the other genes in a shared embryo, have beneficial effects on that embryo. Beneficial means that they make the embryo likely to develop into a successful adult, an adult likely to reproduce and pass those very same genes on to future generations.

What if a mutant gene arose that just happened to have an effect, not upon something obvious like eye colour or curliness of hair, but upon meiosis itself? Suppose it happened to bias meiosis in such a way that it, the mutant gene itself, was more likely than its allelic partner to end up in the egg. There are such genes and they are called segregation distorters. They have a diabolical simplicity. When a segregation distorter arises by mutation, it will spread inexorably through the population at the expense of its allele. It is this that is known as meiotic drive.

Think of how readily we ourselves use the cycles of the earth’s daily rotation, and its yearly circumnavigation of the sun, to structure and order our lives. In the same way, the endlessly repeated growth rhythms imposed by a bottlenecked life cycle will—it seems almost inevitable—be used to order and structure embryology.

We can think of an individual organism as a ‘group’ of cells. A form of group selection can be made to work, provided some means can be found for increasing the ratio of between-group variation to within-group variation. Bottle-wrack’s reproductive habit has exactly the effect of increasing this ratio; splurge-weed’s habit has just the opposite effect.

Firstly the idea that parasites will cooperate with hosts to the extent that their genes pass to the next generation in the same reproductive cells as the genes of the hosts—squeezing through the same bottleneck. And secondly the idea that the cells of a sexually reproducing body cooperate with each other only because meiosis is scrupulously fair.

In philosophy, the difficulty of explaining why somebody can feel anything is often referred to as the Hard Problem. The term was coined by the philosopher David Chalmers. He made his reputation in the early 1990s by a closely argued chain of reasoning, leading him to conclude that conscious experience does not follow from the physical laws that rule the universe.

Despite the hectoring of deconstructionist, “critical” scholars and sociologists, science remains humanity’s most reliable, cumulative, and objective method for comprehending reality. It is far from fail-safe; it is beset with plenty of erroneous conclusions, setbacks, frauds, power struggles among its practitioners, and other human foibles. But it is far better than any alternative in its ability to understand, predict, and manipulate reality. Because science is so good at figuring out the world around us, it should also help us to explain the world within us.

Suppressing knowledge of the certain doom that awaits us all must have been a major factor in the evolution of what Freud calls defense mechanisms (are we the only animals with them? can a chimp suppress or repress?). These are processes by which the brain removes negative feelings, anxiety, guilt, unbidden thoughts, and so on from consciousness. Without such cleansing mechanisms, early humans might have become too transfixed by their ultimate fate to successfully dominate their niche. Perhaps clinical depression amounts to a loss of such defense mechanisms.

In a remote corner of the universe, on a small blue planet gravitating around a humdrum sun in the unfashionable, outer districts of the Milky Way, organisms arose from the primordial mud and ooze in an epic struggle for survival that spanned eons. Despite all evidence to the contrary, these bipedal creatures thought of themselves as extraordinarily privileged, as occupying a unique place in a cosmos of a trillion trillion stars. Conceited as they were, they even believed that they, and only they, could escape the iron law of cause and effect that governs everything. They could do this by virtue of something they called free will, which allowed them to do things without any material reason.

The dominant intellectual position of our day and age is physicalism—at rock bottom all is reducible to physics. There is no need to appeal to anything but space, time, matter, and energy. Physicalism—a halftone away from materialism—is attractive because of its metaphysical sparseness. It makes no additional assumptions.

This book makes the argument that physicalism by itself is too impoverished to explain the origin of mind. In the previous chapter, I sketched an alternative account that augments physicalism. It is a form of property dualism: The theory of integrated information postulates that conscious, phenomenal experience is distinct from its underlying physical carrier.

The fear of judgment is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are, your worth as a person, with your work. From this fear follows the counterproductive drive toward perfectionism, severe self-criticism, and the fear that you must deprive yourself of leisure time in order to satisfy some unseen judge.

Procrastination reduces tension by taking us away from something we view as painful or threatening. The more painful work is for you, the more you will try to seek relief through avoidance or through involvement in more pleasurable activities. The more you feel that endless work deprives you of the pleasure of leisure time, the more you will avoid work.

Thus an answer to Camus' philosophical question about the meaning of life becomes tied to scientific findings, which many philosophers and religious thinkers would consider cheating. They think that philosophy should be concerned with truths that are eternal and absolute, not with the messy and sometimes transient findings of empirical science.

Tying reality to the results of scientific investigations does not in itself rule out spiritual entities such as gods, souls, and angels, for there could be observations and experimental results that are best explained by theories postulating the existence of such entities.

Many people, including even some doctors, have only a weak understanding of the rationale of evidence-based medicine. Some doctors continue to espouse the advantages of “clinical experience,” which may indeed sometimes be a source of reliable observations about effective treatments for diseases. But it is very difficult to separate the reliable from the anecdotal or spurious, given that doctors are prone to cognitive and emotional biases just like other people.

If consciousness can be explained by psychology and neuroscience, then the case for mind-brain identity is overwhelming. I argued that we already have excellent starts on neural explanations for perception, learning, memory, and other mental processes, such as reading. The main phenomena that might support the alternative hypothesis that minds are souls, including reports of communication with the dead, near-death experiences, and parapsychology, can be explained away as incidents of fraud and error.

In sum, attention to how the brain functions in perception supports constructive realism over empiricism and idealism. The constructive nature of perception with both top-down and bottom-up processing shows the implausibility of a narrow empiricism that ties knowledge too closely to sensory input. On the other hand, the robustness of sensory inputs of different kinds counts by inference to the best explanation against the idealist view that the existence of objects is mind dependent.

The second question is much more serious: if concepts can go beyond sense experience, how do we know which of them have anything to do with reality? There are many concepts that may be meaningful because of their relation to other concepts, but which fail to refer to anything in the world.

Perhaps all our current scientific concepts are like that, temporary ways of thinking that will eventually be retired along with the superseded theories that contain them.

According to the fossil record, the first mammals, whose brains were larger and more advanced than those of the reptiles they evolved from, came along only around two hundred million years ago.

minds are brains, so constructive realism is true. Rather, like all inferences, my conclusions are justified by overall coherence: given that minds are brains, and given everything else we know, the most coherent conclusion is that people use perception and inference to the best explanation to construct knowledge about reality. This process of justification will seem circular if you think that knowledge should have a foundation of indubitable truths from which other truths are derived. But no one has ever succeeded in identifying such a foundation in either sense experience or a priori reasoning, so we have to strive instead to construct the most coherent systems of representations that we can.

Philosophers and psychologists have long debated the nature of the emotions, and their proposed theories fall into two main camps: cognitive appraisal and bodily perception. According to cognitive appraisal theories, emotions are judgments about the extent to which a perceived situation accomplishes a person's goals. According to bodily perception theories, however, emotions are not judgments but rather perceptions of physiological states.

Some philosophers will respond that they just can't imagine how feelings could be brain processes, and that they can easily imagine having brains exactly like ours without having any feelings. But I argued in chapter 2 that such capacities and incapacities for understanding the mind as brain should not be taken seriously, because what we manage to conceive is an indicator not of reality, but only of our current limited understanding of it. I predict that progress in neuroscience will continue to make it easier for us to think of mind as brain, and we will only get better at imagining how brains can feel emotions.

One possibility is that emotional and other kinds of consciousness are just by-products of the organizational complexity of the brain, without any special evolutionary contribution. But it is also possible that brains evolved to have feelings as complex representations because of their contribution to the effectiveness of both individuals and groups. A feeling such as happiness or fear can provide a concise summary of the complex unconscious evaluation by constraint satisfaction of the advantages and dangers of a situation. Feelings provide succinct information about anticipated benefits and risks, and thereby foster quick and effective action.

You also have an excellent reason to be more tolerant of others, appreciating that their mistakes are the result not of willful sins but of a multiplicity of causal forces.

Second, understanding moral intuitions as neural processes of emotional consciousness can start to explain why there is both much agreement and much disagreement about what is right and wrong.

Hence the Brain Revolution does not require abandoning the idea of moral responsibility, but it does change it substantially. On the traditional, dualist view, a person is a mind that is a soul, and actions are the result of free choices not fully determined by physical causes. People who make bad choices of their own free will can be held responsible for them and deserve to be punished. But on the view I have been defending, actions are the result of decisions that are physical brain processes, so the point of responsibility and punishment cannot be the sinful nature of what a person has done. Rather, holding people responsible for their actions and punishing them are justified if they have the good social consequences of reducing harm to people in the future. As Gazzaniga suggests, we should think of a person as a social being, understood in terms of relationships to other persons, not just as a brain or body. If persons are conceived as social and the point of holding them responsible is social improvement, then the idea of moral responsibility survives.

At first glance, it might seem that my rejection of free will is incompatible with the need for autonomy. How can people feel that their activities are self-chosen if their decisions are just neural activity? The answer requires replacing the traditional concept of the self, an immortal soul free of physical constraints, with a concept informed by neuroscience. Then the self can be viewed as a complex neural system encompassing representational structures and processing capacities that differentiate between (a) actions that are generated by internal decision making based on intrinsic interests and (b) actions that are externally coerced or motivated.

Identify the appropriate goals of the practices in the given domain, such as truth ( chapter 4 ) and vital needs ( chapter 8 ).

Problems with this view are easily spotted, such as how a nonmaterial being managed to create matter and energy, but there is something more satisfying about the idea of a creator than about the idea of our universe just popping into existence through some kind of inexplicable quantum fluctuation.

What Kierkegaard means is that if you want to live a full, meaningful human life—catch hold of anxiety and don’t let it go. Use anxiety to follow your thoughts as a guide to see where it leads you. Don’t try to escape. Let it energize your life; let it bring you awareness not only of your ignorance but also of your desire to understand moments in every experience. At least for Kierkegaard, holding onto anxiety is a key to a fulfilled life.

What figures like Nietzsche teach us is that the sense of meaninglessness is a result of millennia of dependency on mythological thinking. When myths are shown to be false, the result is a sense of despair because we’ve been dependent upon them for so long. The step out of meaninglessness should not be dependency on a new myth (the New Age movement, Scientology, Mormonism), but self-sufficiency and a tough-mindedness that is weary of resting the sense of meaning on what someone else has said or done or promised. We have to earn meaning for ourselves.

The problem with a claim of this kind, however, is that one can’t borrow another person’s contemplative tools to test it. To see how the feeling of “I” is a product of thought—indeed, to even appreciate how distracted by thought you tend to be in the first place—you have to build your own contemplative tools.

I am not advocating that we be irrationally detached from the reality of our lives. If a problem needs fixing, we should fix it. But how miserable must we be while doing good and necessary things? And if, like many people, you tend to be vaguely unhappy much of the time, it can be very helpful to manufacture a feeling of gratitude by simply contemplating all the terrible things that have not happened to you, or to think of how many people would consider their prayers answered if they could only live as you are now.

Thinking is the basis of every social relationship and cultural institution we have. It is also the foundation of science. But our habitual identification with thought—that is, our failure to recognize thoughts as thoughts, as appearances in consciousness—is a primary source of human suffering. It also gives rise to the illusion that a separate self is living inside one’s head.

As a matter of neurology, the sense of having a persistent and unified self must be an illusion, because it is built upon processes that, by their very nature as processes, are transitory and multifarious. There is no region of the brain that can be the seat of a soul. Everything that makes us human—our emotional lives, capacity for language, the impulses that give rise to complex behavior, and our ability to restrain other impulses that we consider uncivilized—is spread across the entirety of the cortex and many subcortical brain regions as well. The whole brain is involved in making us what we are.

By this Heidegger denoted two related aspects of Dasein: First, humans, whether consciously or not, constantly make choices, and each choice we make prevents other courses of action or life options from being actualized. Second, human existence is characterized by the awareness that it is finite. We know that our time is limited, and that we will die. This immensely heightens the impact of the terminal nature of our choices. Not only did we not actualize some possibilities by choosing to act as we did, but also the finite amount of time we have to live means that we did not have the option of rewinding our lives, so to speak, and trying other options as well. It was one of Heidegger’s seminal insights that awareness of finitude and freedom inevitably generates existential anxiety, which is so difficult to bear that we most of the time fend off this awareness.

The model of the authority of ancient knowledge is problematic nowadays for a number of reasons. For most of human history there was indeed very little well-grounded knowledge of the universe and there was even less systematic knowledge about history and about other cultures. Hence it was much easier for a religion to claim that it was based on the one, true prophet or seer who had received divine revelation. The difficulty of this model became insuperable in the nineteenth century with the advent of modern philology and history.

The essence of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century was that modern natural science no longer made use of symbolic relations to explain the world. In the sixteenth century an explanation of the sort “there are seven planets because the human body has seven orifices” was perfectly acceptable.

While existentialism is certainly not a light-hearted and optimistic view of human existence, it is not nihilist. Its great claim was that meaning is generated in the attempt to face the tragic structure of our existence: knowing that we will die, we can find our freedom by assuming responsibility for our lives and identities without denying the tension generated between our biological nature and the self-awareness that forces us to ask what it means to live a meaningful life.

Romanticism turned all of us into artists. Living a life worth living now meant to be the author of one’s life. Nietzsche formulated the criterion for judging this creation: it had to be a life with inner, aesthetic coherence. Like all artistic creation, this required judicious use of our aesthetic faculties. Yet there is one central difference between the creation of other works of art and that of living a life. An artist can choose his theme, his motif, and his technique. He can pick from a variety of genres and apply his creativity to this. As opposed to that, in living our lives we cannot choose our base materials.

We are not self-created. Our physical existence is the result of an act of sexual intercourse between a man and a woman whom we did not choose to be our parents. Our minds are the result of a multiplicity of influences none of which we control. Our genetic inheritance evolves into mental abilities, temperamental traits, and an emotional disposition that is the biological basis of all we will ever think, feel, and experience. Our perspective onto the world is invariably shaped by the language that constitutes the base materials of our minds, the culture that determines our basic outlook on life, and the social class into which we are born. Our character is indelibly shaped by the impact of the personalities of our parents and educators.

The project of becoming the authors of our lives is an attempt to recreate the aspects of reality that are unbearably fateful, sometimes in fantasy, sometimes in reality. Some people approach this project consciously and deliberately. The self and its life course are shaped in the fashion of a work of art. More often, though, the forces of fate; the desire for authorship; and the multiple layers of pain, desire, anxiety, and rage interact in ways the individual cannot fully decipher.

This sets the stage for the drama of human existence and human individuality. Humans are endowed with two abilities that, to the best of our knowledge, are unique in the animal kingdom.

An existentialist view of life suggests something very different. A life well lived is a life in which an individual’s existential equation is most fully lived. Of course we hope that people learn from their mistakes; we hope that they find ways to live the conflicts and tensions that define them in ways that are creative rather than destructive, and that such creativity enhances both their well-being and their contribution to the world.

In fact it may not be unreasonable to hypothesize that at midlife the need to create something that will create a lasting legacy acquires urgency, because the reality of death becomes more tangible.

From the point of view of existential psychology, it is not surprising that religion has remained so enormously powerful. Given that defending against death anxiety is, psychologically speaking, the most important function of worldviews, religion has a huge advantage on secular meaning-systems.

Religions are, in any case, the most efficient forms of the denial of death.

Existential psychology provides a strong rationale for the assumption that the European Enlightenment’s prediction during the nineteenth century that the rule of religion would one day be replaced by secular ideologies based on science is unlikely to come true. The human need to deny death is too powerful.

This ideology failed because it was a profoundly inauthentic prescription: it is humanly impossible to genuinely respect beliefs no matter how irrational, immoral, or absurd. The resulting culture was emotionally frozen and often did not lead to fruitful discussion between worldviews in general, and between secularism and religion in particular.

The difference between civilized disdain and political correctness is that the former allows one to feel disdain for a person’s or group’s views or beliefs while maintaining respect for the human beings that hold them.

The findings of existential psychology are pertinent to the question of how to deal with the conflict between science and religion. As we have seen when people’s belief systems are attacked, the result is inevitably that they dig more deeply into the trenches of their worldview. Even if you agree with Dawkins, Dennett, and Hitchens that liberalism should no longer tolerate attacks while being sensitive toward the feelings of the religiously inclined; no rational person can expect that their polemic will convince the religious to leave their creed, certainly not after the data produced by existential psychology.

But let us not delude ourselves: the value of these books is to raise the spirits of liberal atheists who had been made to feel that they had no right to fight for their views. These spirited counterattacks certainly succeeded in reestablishing some esprit de corps of those committed to Enlightenment values and the scientific worldview. But the primary effect of such aggressive rhetoric is primarily to rally our side. We should not think that all-out attacks on religion will convert anybody. The scientific evidence shows that the opposite is likely to be true. Hence the frontal attack on religion may have the positive effect of lifting the spirits of secularists who have felt on the defensive for years, but it certainly is not a fruitful strategy to solve the world’s problems, as they will only reach the converted at best and outrage those criticized at worst.

We should be able to marvel at the variety of collectively created fictions invented to provide meaning to human life rather than thundering at those we like least. Of course anti-theists and religious believers will continue to disdain each other’s worldviews, which is fine as long as it doesn’t turn into a matter of life and death. Civilized and cheerful disdain could provide a model for all ideologies—religious and secular—by replacing bilious self-righteousness with laughter; and it could make us see human history as something more akin to a contest for best collective work of fiction than to a mortal clash of civilizations.

Tolerance is full-fledged acceptance of a point of view, group, or ideology. Toleration is the state of affairs in which we say that we are willing to tolerate a point of view, religion, or political attitude even though we condemn it. Toleration demands nothing more from us than to feel that we can live with a certain form of life or worldview in our society, even though we find it primitive, immoral, and reprehensible.

To feel anger, hurt, and disdain without violence and to maintain communication with those whose views we do not respect and who do not respect ours are the basis for the type of world citizenship that has become a vital necessity in a globally interconnected world.

Freedom of the mind is not a religious principle; it is a principle of various Enlightenment movements from India through Greece to eighteenth-century Europe, and this principle historically and philosophically clashes with the principle of the superiority of faith.

The evolutionary psychology of religion, based on a wealth of anthropological and experimental data, is based on two major findings. 27 One is that we humans are hardwired to overdetect intentional agents. We see a shadow in the woods and tend to overinterpret it as either animal or human. This is often called the “hyperactive agent detector device” or HADD, because it leads to many false positives. The reason the hardwired HADD was advantageous in an evolutionary sense is simple: under jungle conditions, false positives are better than false negatives because they alert us to the possibility of dangerous predators, and a single false negative can be lethal.

As opposed to human agents, the gods can know whether we really live according to our society’s rules or not. Hence belief in gods binds the members of a society together with very strong ties indeed.

This is the source of the age-old conflict between religion and science. Science, the open-minded investigation of laws of nature, invariably leads to naturalistic explanations of human events. There were good reasons, therefore, why religions have been hostile to science, because it undermines the cognitive and ethical foundations of religion.

Epicurus was part of the Greek Enlightenment. He believed that true freedom was not possible as long as humans are afraid of the gods. Only when we understand that the world is ruled by blind natural law can we finally begin to live our lives rationally and be free or experience eudaemonia (“human flourishing,” often misleadingly translated as “happiness”).

The Epicurean tradition points to a deep logical mistake engrained in human psychology. We tend to try to imagine what it would be like to be dead. We do so even if we don’t believe in an afterlife. In doing so we imagine being dead and what it would feel like. But this involves a contradiction in terms: when we are dead (assuming that there is no afterlife and this is not the issue) there is no thinking or feeling subject that can feel anything.

Lucretius argues that none of us is saddened by the fact that there was an infinite time span before we were born in which we didn’t exist. Why should it sadden us that there will be an infinite time span after we die in which we will not exist? Why should the infinity of time before we were born be less of a reason to mourn than the infinity of time after we die?

I don’t think that anybody today truly expects the Epicurean arguments to completely abolish the human fear of death. Most of this fear is not rationally based. It is part of our evolutionary heritage that like all animals we are terrorized by anything that threatens our lives. This terror of death is an evolutionary necessity since no animal that doesn’t try avoiding death would survive long enough to reproduce.

The most destructive manifestations of fanaticism in recent history (i.e., suicide and terror attacks) are to be explained by the denial of death. Even physical death, to the fanatic, is preferable to accepting our mortality, paradoxical as this may sound.

The world citizenship I am talking about is of a very different sort. It is based on the realization that globalization has led to the point where there is no longer a space on earth that is outside civilization and that political consciousness can no longer be restricted to one country, culture, or religion and thus needs to address the fate of humanity as a whole.

The Temple Mount is the epicenter of a murderous fanaticism that is keeping the world on its toes. It is the embodiment of all the deleterious effects of worldview defense against death awareness. It shows the catastrophic impact of the need to cling to a worldview that provides symbolic immortality to its most extreme manifestations: the willingness to kill and, even more paradoxically, to die for it. Is the effect of worldviews invariably deleterious at best and catastrophic at worst?

Berlin showed the possibility of accepting the historical contingency of one’s own position without falling into cynicism. His ability to stick to his beliefs without being dogmatic about them may indeed be one of the marks of the civilized mind and “the ultimate test of character for the individual.”

As infants we did not know about the world’s vastness or its dangers. We were protected from it by humans whose powers seemed unlimited. Our caretakers provided us with all that we needed and we had no idea about what it took for them to do so. It seemed to depend on nothing but their will on whether we would receive food, shelter, and comfort. Freud’s argument was that this experience, while not consciously remembered, leaves an indelible mark on our unconscious and we are left with a lifelong yearning for unbounded protection.

Well-meaning liberals who believe that any worldview that is too different from theirs is a pathological reaction to Western misdeeds are empirically wrong and ideologically misguided. Reducing such belief systems to psychopathology is a form of naiveté, as it assumes that any worldview that doesn’t correspond can be brushed aside as nothing but a reaction to some grievances and fails to realize that the human mind is prone to the seduction of closed worldviews.

And yet the temptation to write, “Members of Homo globalis of all nations, unite!” is too great to resist. Maybe the pooled creativity of those who understand that humankind has been united by fate, if not by design and intelligence, will carry the day once more; not by competing with other species and erasing them, but by creating a new form of solidarity of the human species that, by blind chance, has reached both the abysses of genocide and environmental havoc and the heights of individual and collective creation that surpass anything our scarred globe has ever seen.
