Formally speaking, being ignostic means that every theological position assumes too much about God, and thus it is one of the most intellectually honest positions one can hold about theism. For the ignostic, it is impossible to properly answer any question about belief in God because it isn’t clear what the term “God” means.

Religion, maybe more than any other effort humanity has engaged in, has sought to provide moral understanding, and the world’s religions are often very sophisticated proto-psychological systems. Their weaknesses are in lacking a reliable method to sort the good from the bad, a certain reluctance to reject attitudes that are clear moral failures (slavery, among others, stands out), and believing a bit too righteously in themselves.

In a sentence, “God” is an abstract idea that is used to meet, fill, or ignore a variety of core psychosocial needs experienced by almost all human beings. The primary needs “God” exists to address relate to meaning making, control, and esteem, which manifest in terms of attribution, control, and sociality in various complicated and overlapping ways.

when nonbelievers say, “there is no God,” which we have every reason to believe is true as they mean it, they are saying something utterly unintelligible to believers. Believers believe there is a God because they know there is a “God”—a set of ideas that speak to and help them make sense of their core needs and values. What they don’t realize is that they are making a mistake by accepting theism. By accepting theism, they mistake a myth for reality.

These days, Poseidon is easy to understand as a mythological construction used to account for the various and sometimes unpredictable behaviors of the sea, and thus the fates of sailors and those living upon the coasts.

For religious belief, we need to appreciate that belief is secondary to the application of the beliefs. Religious believers believe in order to meet certain needs, and the beliefs follow the needs. What they end up believing is a mythological rendering of a collection of abstract ideas that help them meet or ignore some of their needs.

trying to pry away the faith of someone who is rapidly approaching death is almost as pointless and reprehensible as attempting to squeeze a deathbed conversion out of them.

It is a bad idea that some claims to truth or knowledge regarding our societies are privileged to a weaker standard of justification than others. Secularism is the rejection of that bad idea.

Courses like civics, ethics, logic, critical thinking, and comparative religions might be identifiable as topics many “atheists” are interested in—along with biology, physics, psychology, and just about every other field of inquiry15—but that’s only a reflection of the underlying fact that the religions aren’t actually true.

Quant au fait qu’il y ait toujours des personnalités fragiles qui ne peuvent pas entrer dans des processus sociaux tels que nous les préconisons, cela nous conduit à poser qu’il faut dans tous les cas garantir par un revenu d’existence des conditions de subsistance élémentaires pour ceux qui ne sauraient pas faire valoir leurs droits à un revenu contributif.

on ne va pas donner un salaire au robot : le robot ne consomme pas plus que l’énergie dont il a besoin. C’est donc aux individus privés d’emploi par les robots qu’il faut donner un salaire. Mais puisqu’il n’y a plus ni emploi ni chômage, ce ne sera ni un salaire ni une allocation de chômage : ce sera un revenu contributif. Ce revenu contributif, c’est un revenu alloué à tout le monde sur une base qui permet de vivre décemment, de s’éduquer et de développer ce que Amartya Sen appelle des capacités, c’est-à-dire des formes de savoir, que la société a besoin de valoriser et qui est un droit « rechargeable » en fonction de l’activité de socialisation de capacités ainsi développées par les individus en direction des groupes.
