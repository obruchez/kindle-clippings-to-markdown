Formally speaking, being ignostic means that every theological position assumes too much about God, and thus it is one of the most intellectually honest positions one can hold about theism. For the ignostic, it is impossible to properly answer any question about belief in God because it isn’t clear what the term “God” means.

Religion, maybe more than any other effort humanity has engaged in, has sought to provide moral understanding, and the world’s religions are often very sophisticated proto-psychological systems. Their weaknesses are in lacking a reliable method to sort the good from the bad, a certain reluctance to reject attitudes that are clear moral failures (slavery, among others, stands out), and believing a bit too righteously in themselves.

In a sentence, “God” is an abstract idea that is used to meet, fill, or ignore a variety of core psychosocial needs experienced by almost all human beings. The primary needs “God” exists to address relate to meaning making, control, and esteem, which manifest in terms of attribution, control, and sociality in various complicated and overlapping ways.

when nonbelievers say, “there is no God,” which we have every reason to believe is true as they mean it, they are saying something utterly unintelligible to believers. Believers believe there is a God because they know there is a “God”—a set of ideas that speak to and help them make sense of their core needs and values. What they don’t realize is that they are making a mistake by accepting theism. By accepting theism, they mistake a myth for reality.

These days, Poseidon is easy to understand as a mythological construction used to account for the various and sometimes unpredictable behaviors of the sea, and thus the fates of sailors and those living upon the coasts.

For religious belief, we need to appreciate that belief is secondary to the application of the beliefs. Religious believers believe in order to meet certain needs, and the beliefs follow the needs. What they end up believing is a mythological rendering of a collection of abstract ideas that help them meet or ignore some of their needs.

It is a bad idea that some claims to truth or knowledge regarding our societies are privileged to a weaker standard of justification than others. Secularism is the rejection of that bad idea.

on ne va pas donner un salaire au robot : le robot ne consomme pas plus que l’énergie dont il a besoin. C’est donc aux individus privés d’emploi par les robots qu’il faut donner un salaire. Mais puisqu’il n’y a plus ni emploi ni chômage, ce ne sera ni un salaire ni une allocation de chômage : ce sera un revenu contributif. Ce revenu contributif, c’est un revenu alloué à tout le monde sur une base qui permet de vivre décemment, de s’éduquer et de développer ce que Amartya Sen appelle des capacités, c’est-à-dire des formes de savoir, que la société a besoin de valoriser et qui est un droit « rechargeable » en fonction de l’activité de socialisation de capacités ainsi développées par les individus en direction des groupes.

Do you realise that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that’s available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges — absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?

And yet — no one could be sure. He might himself be putting on a superb act, following the performance by logic alone and with his own strange emotions completely untouched, as an anthropologist might take part in some primitive rite. The fact that he uttered the appropriate sounds, and made the expected responses, really proved nothing at all.

La dépression est le moyen trouvé, à son insu, pour ralentir. Elle est l’une des formes les plus intolérables de la disparition de soi sur laquelle l’individu perd toute prise pour un long moment. Mais elle est aussi un sas pour revenir un jour à l’existence avec plus de recul en ayant retrouvé le goût de vivre, et capable désormais d’assumer le fait d’être soi.

L’identité que se construit et se reconstruit l’individu à travers sa narration est sans doute une fiction, mais elle est le seul moyen de s’approcher de soi à travers un processus sans fin qui ne cesse de se moduler. Elle est parfois d’ailleurs amendée par les autres qui ne le reconnaissent pas entièrement dans son récit, et qui le corrige ou le complètent en le réinsérant dans un ensemble à plusieurs voix.

Nos existences sont autant faites des occasions manquées que des événements qui les ponctuent. Nul ne peut vivre toutes les virtualités qui étaient en lui, ni même les imaginer. Chaque instant qui passe laisse derrière soi une infinité de vies possibles qui n’ont tenu qu’à un souffle. Le hasard, ce que l’individu en fait, sa volonté de chance ou son abandon aux circonstances, dessinent des parcours personnels qui auraient pu être radicalement autres.

Ce sont des lieux où nul n’a plus de comptes à rendre, une suspension heureuse et joyeuse de soi, un détour qui ramène à soi après quelques heures ou quelques jours, ou davantage. Des moyens délibérés de retrouver sa vitalité, son intériorité, le goût de vivre.

A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves.

And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years—whether it be through meditation, through reading philosophy, or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in South Africa—is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind. This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death.

Whatever gets loaded into a machine might be a replica of my consciousness, but it’s difficult to make any case that it is my consciousness, especially if I am still alive. The moment it gets uploaded, it would also become different and separate, and while it may “live” on after my death, it doesn’t do anything to deal with the fact that I still die.

Even so, uploading ourselves digitally doesn’t escape death. Nothing does. The server running the simulation, supposing even that it could maintain itself and otherwise avoid failure, needs energy, and there are no unending sources of energy in the universe.

It requires shockingly little, it seems, to trigger our innate uneasiness with mortality—so little that we eagerly engage in denying the most obvious fact about human beings: that we are animals.

In the end, there is little but love, connection, and the remembered echoes of happiness, and few of us, in our last calculation, will want to be remembered by strangers for greatness so much as we will wish to have been great for those we were closest to, including ourselves.

Religious immortality stories deny the reality of death by insisting on the reality of the soul, and the fate and quality of the soul are understood religiously in almost explicitly moral terms.

The central promise of most religions is that death is either not real or not final, but that salvation from death is not guaranteed.

The denial of death, however, proves a true and enduring obstacle to living fully. Death is hard enough to face as it is, and immortality stories make it far more difficult.

When we talk about “being dead,” we are lying to ourselves, misleading ourselves by our very language to believe that there is some experience of death.

Analogies are tempting but unhelpful for making sense of what it is like to be dead because it isn’t like anything to be dead. Being dead is the precise opposite of being, at all.

A very popular comparison (among those who do not believe in an afterlife) is that “being dead” is qualitatively the same as what it is like before being born.

Sleep can only be likened to death in that for some portions of it we lay still, are oblivious to the world outside our minds, and, in its deepest phases, register no conscious awareness.

Death is not like sleep, and it is only “like” anesthesia if something goes badly enough so that you don’t wake up (and thus actually die, killing the analogy). Death is the beginning of the total, irrevocable, and permanent absence of experience.

The nothingness of death is the kind of nothing that simply isn’t. To attempt to describe it would fail because merely attempting to imagine it makes it into something—and something it isn’t.

The peak-end effect is believed to be caused by certain biases in how we store and consider memories that relate to how we conceive of ourselves. In some ways, we possess something like two distinct mental selves. One self experiences, and the other remembers.

That is, the fear of dying badly obscures the mirror of death and interferes with the view we might otherwise have of living. When we see it for what it is and set it aside, we have an opportunity to learn a lot about how to live better lives.
