Formally speaking, being ignostic means that every theological position assumes too much about God, and thus it is one of the most intellectually honest positions one can hold about theism. For the ignostic, it is impossible to properly answer any question about belief in God because it isn’t clear what the term “God” means.

Religion, maybe more than any other effort humanity has engaged in, has sought to provide moral understanding, and the world’s religions are often very sophisticated proto-psychological systems. Their weaknesses are in lacking a reliable method to sort the good from the bad, a certain reluctance to reject attitudes that are clear moral failures (slavery, among others, stands out), and believing a bit too righteously in themselves.

In a sentence, “God” is an abstract idea that is used to meet, fill, or ignore a variety of core psychosocial needs experienced by almost all human beings. The primary needs “God” exists to address relate to meaning making, control, and esteem, which manifest in terms of attribution, control, and sociality in various complicated and overlapping ways.

when nonbelievers say, “there is no God,” which we have every reason to believe is true as they mean it, they are saying something utterly unintelligible to believers. Believers believe there is a God because they know there is a “God”—a set of ideas that speak to and help them make sense of their core needs and values. What they don’t realize is that they are making a mistake by accepting theism. By accepting theism, they mistake a myth for reality.

These days, Poseidon is easy to understand as a mythological construction used to account for the various and sometimes unpredictable behaviors of the sea, and thus the fates of sailors and those living upon the coasts.

For religious belief, we need to appreciate that belief is secondary to the application of the beliefs. Religious believers believe in order to meet certain needs, and the beliefs follow the needs. What they end up believing is a mythological rendering of a collection of abstract ideas that help them meet or ignore some of their needs.

It is a bad idea that some claims to truth or knowledge regarding our societies are privileged to a weaker standard of justification than others. Secularism is the rejection of that bad idea.

on ne va pas donner un salaire au robot : le robot ne consomme pas plus que l’énergie dont il a besoin. C’est donc aux individus privés d’emploi par les robots qu’il faut donner un salaire. Mais puisqu’il n’y a plus ni emploi ni chômage, ce ne sera ni un salaire ni une allocation de chômage : ce sera un revenu contributif. Ce revenu contributif, c’est un revenu alloué à tout le monde sur une base qui permet de vivre décemment, de s’éduquer et de développer ce que Amartya Sen appelle des capacités, c’est-à-dire des formes de savoir, que la société a besoin de valoriser et qui est un droit « rechargeable » en fonction de l’activité de socialisation de capacités ainsi développées par les individus en direction des groupes.

Do you realise that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that’s available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges — absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?

And yet — no one could be sure. He might himself be putting on a superb act, following the performance by logic alone and with his own strange emotions completely untouched, as an anthropologist might take part in some primitive rite. The fact that he uttered the appropriate sounds, and made the expected responses, really proved nothing at all.

La dépression est le moyen trouvé, à son insu, pour ralentir. Elle est l’une des formes les plus intolérables de la disparition de soi sur laquelle l’individu perd toute prise pour un long moment. Mais elle est aussi un sas pour revenir un jour à l’existence avec plus de recul en ayant retrouvé le goût de vivre, et capable désormais d’assumer le fait d’être soi.

L’identité que se construit et se reconstruit l’individu à travers sa narration est sans doute une fiction, mais elle est le seul moyen de s’approcher de soi à travers un processus sans fin qui ne cesse de se moduler. Elle est parfois d’ailleurs amendée par les autres qui ne le reconnaissent pas entièrement dans son récit, et qui le corrige ou le complètent en le réinsérant dans un ensemble à plusieurs voix.

Nos existences sont autant faites des occasions manquées que des événements qui les ponctuent. Nul ne peut vivre toutes les virtualités qui étaient en lui, ni même les imaginer. Chaque instant qui passe laisse derrière soi une infinité de vies possibles qui n’ont tenu qu’à un souffle. Le hasard, ce que l’individu en fait, sa volonté de chance ou son abandon aux circonstances, dessinent des parcours personnels qui auraient pu être radicalement autres.

Ce sont des lieux où nul n’a plus de comptes à rendre, une suspension heureuse et joyeuse de soi, un détour qui ramène à soi après quelques heures ou quelques jours, ou davantage. Des moyens délibérés de retrouver sa vitalité, son intériorité, le goût de vivre.

A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves.

And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years—whether it be through meditation, through reading philosophy, or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in South Africa—is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind. This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death.

Whatever gets loaded into a machine might be a replica of my consciousness, but it’s difficult to make any case that it is my consciousness, especially if I am still alive. The moment it gets uploaded, it would also become different and separate, and while it may “live” on after my death, it doesn’t do anything to deal with the fact that I still die.

as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialised in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilisation. With the development of machine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels.

According to what I called the Fitting Fulfillment View, a life is meaningful insofar as its subjective attractions are to things or goals that are objectively worthwhile. That is, one’s life is meaningful insofar as one finds oneself loving things worthy of love and able to do something positive about it.

elitism and parochialism are dangers that we need to be wary of, especially perhaps when making judgments about the relative value of what other people do with their lives. But we can minimize these dangers if we keep our fallibility in mind, if we regard our judgments as tentative, and if we remind ourselves, when necessary, that the object of thinking about the category of meaningfulness in life is not to produce a meaningfulness scale for ranking lives.

Whereas worries about elitism call our attention to the dangers of thinking one knows which things, activities, or projects have value, the second set of concerns, more purely philosophical, raises questions about the idea that there is such a thing as an objective standard of value at all, or more precisely, an objective standard that distinguishes some projects, activities, and interests from others as being more fitting for or more capable of contributing to the meaningfulness of one’s life.

Rather than continue the search for a single term to name an attitude or psychological condition that any meaningful life must involve, it might be wiser, if less satisfyingly determinate, simply to acknowledge that there is a range of such attitudes and conditions, which includes love and fulfillment, and which reflects the kind of intentional, but also qualitatively positive, attachment to an object or activity that an agent must have in order for engagement with it to contribute to the meaningfulness of his life.

What is so good about doing what it is in one’s nature to do? Does it matter what kind of nature one has? Does it matter, for example, whether one’s nature is peaceable or belligerent, creative or imitative, social or solitary? These questions are especially pressing if we identify fulfillment with meaningfulness.

By focusing on one activity or project at a time, or on lives that are predominantly bound up with a single project, we were able to illustrate and test our ideas more clearly and more vividly than if we had discussed lives that were, or were noticed to be, more complex and varied. But most lives are more complex and varied.

As an activity or practice gains recognition and popularity, as traditions develop and groups organize around it, the opportunities for valuable activities involving it multiply: one can not only play basketball, one can coach it, teach it, write about it. Even being a fan can be a strand in the fabric that connects one to others, supplying a ready topic of conversation or just a knowing bond that links one to one’s neighbors or one’s community.

In arguing that meaningfulness is a distinctive dimension of a good life, different from both happiness and moral goodness, and that the concept of meaningfulness is essentially tied to a commitment to objective distinctions in value, I have tried to show the importance of keeping the vocabulary of meaningfulness and value alive, and of not assimilating or reducing these terms to others that we are more comfortable with in both philosophy and popular culture.

Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What’s the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analyzing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids’ brain cells.

It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.

Malgré tout mon scepticisme, il m’est resté un peu de superstition irrationnelle, telle cette curieuse conviction que tout événement qui m’advient comporte en plus un sens, qu’il signifie quelque chose ; que par sa propre histoire la vie nous parle, nous révèle graduellement un secret, qu’elle s’offre comme un rébus à déchiffrer, que les histoires que nous vivons forment en même temps une mythologie de notre vie et que cette mythologie détient la clé de la vérité et du mystère.

What these students could expect at one of Epictetus’s lectures was not a one-way communication, from Epictetus to his students, about esoteric philosophical theories. To the contrary, he wanted his students to take his lectures personally. He wanted his remarks to strike close to home. He therefore told his students that a Stoic school should be like a physician’s consulting room and that patients should leave feeling bad rather than feeling good,22 the idea being that any treatment likely to cure a patient is also likely to cause him discomfort.

According to Epictetus, the primary concern of philosophy should be the art of living: Just as wood is the medium of the carpenter and bronze is the medium of the sculptor, your life is the medium on which you practice the art of living.

ANY THOUGHTFUL PERSON will periodically contemplate the bad things that can happen to him. The obvious reason for doing this is to prevent those things from happening.

Seneca therefore points to a second reason for contemplating the bad things that can happen to us. If we think about these things, we will lessen their impact on us when, despite our efforts at prevention, they happen:

there is a third and arguably much more important reason. We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.

The problem, though, is that once they fulfill a desire for something, they adapt to its presence in their life and as a result stop desiring it—or at any rate, don’t find it as desirable as they once did. They end up just as dissatisfied as they were before fulfilling the desire.

One key to happiness, then, is to forestall the adaptation process: We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking for granted, once we get them, the things we worked so hard to get.

A practicing Stoic will keep the trichotomy of control firmly in mind as he goes about his daily affairs. He will perform a kind of triage in which he sorts the elements of his life into three categories: those over which he has complete control, those over which he has no control at all, and those over which he has some but not complete control. The things in the second category—those over which he has no control at all—he will set aside as not worth worrying about. In doing this, he will spare himself a great deal of needless anxiety. He will instead concern himself with things over which he has complete control and things over which he has some but not complete control. And when he concerns himself with things in this last category, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals for himself and will thereby avoid a considerable amount of frustration and disappointment.

Suppose, however, that I don’t respect the source of an insult; indeed, suppose that I take him to be a thoroughly contemptible individual. Under such circumstances, rather than feeling hurt by his insults, I should feel relieved: If he disapproves of what I am doing, then what I am doing is doubtless the right thing to do.

Nothing is more pathetic, after all, than a person who, a day after being insulted, walks up to the person who insulted him, reminds him of what the insult was, and then gives his reply to it. The Stoics realized this and as a result advocated a second way to respond to insults: with no response at all.

Advocates of politically correct speech therefore petition the authorities—government officials, employers, and school administrators—to punish anyone who insults a disadvantaged individual. Epictetus would reject this manner of dealing with insults as being woefully counterproductive. He would point out, to begin with, that the political correctness movement has some untoward side effects. One is that the process of protecting disadvantaged individuals from insults will tend to make them hypersensitive to insults:

Although the strategy of gaining happiness by working to get whatever it is we find ourselves wanting is obvious and has been used by most people throughout recorded history and across cultures, it has an important defect, as thoughtful people throughout recorded history and across cultures have realized: For each desire we fulfill in accordance with this strategy, a new desire will pop into our head to take its place. This means that no matter how hard we work to satisfy our desires, we will be no closer to satisfaction than if we had fulfilled none of them.

Among their recommendations were the following: • We should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reflect on how we responded to the day’s events. How did we respond to an insult? To the loss of a possession? To a stressful situation? Did we, in our responses, put Stoic psychological strategies to work? • We should use our reasoning ability to overcome negative emotions. We should also use our reasoning ability to master our desires, to the extent that it is possible to do so. In particular, we should use reason to convince ourselves that things such as fame and fortune aren’t worth having—not, at any rate, if what we seek is tranquility—and therefore aren’t worth pursuing. Likewise, we should use our reasoning ability to convince ourselves that even though certain activities are pleasurable, engaging in those activities will disrupt our tranquility, and the tranquility lost will outweigh the pleasure gained. • If, despite not having pursued wealth, we find ourselves wealthy, we should enjoy our affluence; it was the Cynics, not the Stoics, who advocated asceticism. But although we should enjoy wealth, we should not cling to it; indeed, even as we enjoy it, we should contemplate its loss. • We are social creatures; we will be miserable if we try to cut off contact with other people. Therefore, if what we seek is tranquility, we should form and maintain relations with others. In doing so, though, we should be careful about whom we befriend. We should also, to the extent possible, avoid people whose values are corrupt, for fear that their values will contaminate ours. • Other people are invariably annoying, though, so if we maintain relations with them, they will periodically upset our tranquility—if we let them. The Stoics spent a considerable amount of time devising techniques for taking the pain out of our relationships with other people. In particular, they came up with techniques for dealing with the insults of others and preventing them from angering us. • The Stoics pointed to two principal sources of human unhappiness—our insatiability and our tendency to worry about things beyond our control—and they developed techniques for removing these sources of unhappiness from our life. • To conquer our insatiability, the Stoics advise us to engage in negative visualization. We should contemplate the impermanence of all things. We should imagine ourselves losing the things we most value, including possessions and loved ones. We should also imagine the loss of our own life. If we do this, we will come to appreciate the things we now have, and because we appreciate them, we will be less likely to form desires for other things. And besides simply imagining that things could be worse than they are, we should sometimes cause things to be worse than they would otherwise be; Seneca advises us to “practice poverty,” and Musonius advises us voluntarily to forgo opportunities for pleasure and comfort. • To curb our tendency to worry about things beyond our control, the Stoics advise us to perform a kind of triage with respect to the elements of our life and sort them into those we have no control over, those we have complete control over, and those we have some but not complete control over. Having done this, we should not bother about things over which we have no control. Instead, we should spend some of our time dealing with things over which we have complete control, such as our goals and values, and spend most of our time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control. If we do this, we will avoid experiencing much needless anxiety. • When we spend time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control, we should be careful to internalize our goals. My goal in playing tennis, for example, should be not to win the match but to play the best match possible. • We should be fatalistic with respect to the external world: We should realize that what has happened to us in the past and what is happening to us at this very moment are beyond our control, so it is foolish to get upset about these things.

Why does the theory of evolution provoke such objections, whereas nobody seems to care about the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics? How come politicians don’t ask that kids be exposed to alternative theories about matter, energy, space and time? After all, Darwin’s ideas seem at first sight far less threatening than the monstrosities of Einstein and Werner Heisenberg. The theory of evolution rests on the principle of the survival of the fittest, which is a clear and simple – not to say humdrum – idea. In contrast, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics argue that you can twist time and space, that something can appear out of nothing, and that a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time. This makes a mockery of our common sense, yet nobody seeks to protect innocent schoolchildren from these scandalous ideas.

They are ‘dividuals’.

Jazz has usually been thought of as a group activity, born of the interaction between musicians in the moment of performance. The manner in which musicians interact while performing not only is an important stylistic component of jazz but can come to be part of a larger narrative of musical progress. Perhaps for this reason solo playing has been relegated to a footnote in jazz history, subservient to a narrative in which ensembles dominate.

Taken together then, what do these examples from the Corea and Jarrett albums say about form? Both records contain a number of pieces with conventional cyclical forms, suggesting that the musicians were not entirely rejecting the postbop model of song form, and indeed were quite happy to work within that model. At the same time, many of the pieces on the albums suggested a new relationship between improviser and form, and a new way of conceptualizing composition.

Whereas a composer can choose to craft a piece in a variety of ways, not working in a linear fashion but shaping segments one at a time, and revising previously written material, an improviser is locked into a temporality in which material cannot be revised once it is played.1

Perhaps it is the case that a quality of liveness emerges from the recording as a result of how listeners are inclined to share in this temporality with the improviser, to hear the music as it is being created and to understand it as such.

There is a considerable amount of reverberation added to the recording.

these vocalizations are sometimes parallel to, and in tune with, the musical line, while at other times they are parallel but out of tune.11 Vocalizing along with lines like this has an important effect: not only does it help convey for the listener the physical effort involved in improvising, but it also makes an implicit association with singing.

This sense of non intention is contributed to by Jarrett’s seeming to stumble onto this A major chord, and then after hearing it, repeating it again and again.

Tesser’s review serves to confirm that Jarrett’s music was heard, by some listeners, in terms of a non-Western aesthetic. A certain kind of musical stasis, executed by means of harmonically immobile vamp passages, was part of a more general cultural potential music could possess to evoke altered states of consciousness

Pedal noise is a device he uses deliberately elsewhere. In this case the noise is not of a sufficient volume to be audible above the notes, but it functions in auditory terms almost like a bass drum, placed low in the mix, articulating the four beats of the meter. It is also placed slightly ahead of the beat, having the effect of propelling the music by anticipating the beat.

This kind of binary opposition is deeply flawed, not least because many improvisers prepare for what they do, and many composers create musical fragments or even whole pieces with the same speed as improvisers.

I have been keen to suggest that this record came to stand for something, to function in variety of ways as a symbol of an idealized spontaneous creativity, an acoustic music free from the trappings of electronics. We can see at this point how those conceptions can become something rather different. The use of the record as background music emphasizes its potential functionality. The recording itself is not so important; more significant are the opportunities it affords its listeners.

The Köln Concert sits on a kind of aesthetic faultline. On the one side, its invocation of the improvisatory ideal places it within a jazz tradition that valorizes the importance of the spontaneous performance over the methodical and carefully rehearsed approach, even at the risk of idealizing this aesthetic to the point of distortion. But on the other, the history of the record’s associations in the 1970s as a “coffee table” item, relegating it to the status of background music, and then in some of the usages discussed previously, suggests that it is something jazz records are not expected to be.
