Formally speaking, being ignostic means that every theological position assumes too much about God, and thus it is one of the most intellectually honest positions one can hold about theism. For the ignostic, it is impossible to properly answer any question about belief in God because it isn’t clear what the term “God” means.

Religion, maybe more than any other effort humanity has engaged in, has sought to provide moral understanding, and the world’s religions are often very sophisticated proto-psychological systems. Their weaknesses are in lacking a reliable method to sort the good from the bad, a certain reluctance to reject attitudes that are clear moral failures (slavery, among others, stands out), and believing a bit too righteously in themselves.

In a sentence, “God” is an abstract idea that is used to meet, fill, or ignore a variety of core psychosocial needs experienced by almost all human beings. The primary needs “God” exists to address relate to meaning making, control, and esteem, which manifest in terms of attribution, control, and sociality in various complicated and overlapping ways.

when nonbelievers say, “there is no God,” which we have every reason to believe is true as they mean it, they are saying something utterly unintelligible to believers. Believers believe there is a God because they know there is a “God”—a set of ideas that speak to and help them make sense of their core needs and values. What they don’t realize is that they are making a mistake by accepting theism. By accepting theism, they mistake a myth for reality.

These days, Poseidon is easy to understand as a mythological construction used to account for the various and sometimes unpredictable behaviors of the sea, and thus the fates of sailors and those living upon the coasts.

For religious belief, we need to appreciate that belief is secondary to the application of the beliefs. Religious believers believe in order to meet certain needs, and the beliefs follow the needs. What they end up believing is a mythological rendering of a collection of abstract ideas that help them meet or ignore some of their needs.

It is a bad idea that some claims to truth or knowledge regarding our societies are privileged to a weaker standard of justification than others. Secularism is the rejection of that bad idea.

on ne va pas donner un salaire au robot : le robot ne consomme pas plus que l’énergie dont il a besoin. C’est donc aux individus privés d’emploi par les robots qu’il faut donner un salaire. Mais puisqu’il n’y a plus ni emploi ni chômage, ce ne sera ni un salaire ni une allocation de chômage : ce sera un revenu contributif. Ce revenu contributif, c’est un revenu alloué à tout le monde sur une base qui permet de vivre décemment, de s’éduquer et de développer ce que Amartya Sen appelle des capacités, c’est-à-dire des formes de savoir, que la société a besoin de valoriser et qui est un droit « rechargeable » en fonction de l’activité de socialisation de capacités ainsi développées par les individus en direction des groupes.

Do you realise that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that’s available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges — absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?

And yet — no one could be sure. He might himself be putting on a superb act, following the performance by logic alone and with his own strange emotions completely untouched, as an anthropologist might take part in some primitive rite. The fact that he uttered the appropriate sounds, and made the expected responses, really proved nothing at all.

La dépression est le moyen trouvé, à son insu, pour ralentir. Elle est l’une des formes les plus intolérables de la disparition de soi sur laquelle l’individu perd toute prise pour un long moment. Mais elle est aussi un sas pour revenir un jour à l’existence avec plus de recul en ayant retrouvé le goût de vivre, et capable désormais d’assumer le fait d’être soi.

L’identité que se construit et se reconstruit l’individu à travers sa narration est sans doute une fiction, mais elle est le seul moyen de s’approcher de soi à travers un processus sans fin qui ne cesse de se moduler. Elle est parfois d’ailleurs amendée par les autres qui ne le reconnaissent pas entièrement dans son récit, et qui le corrige ou le complètent en le réinsérant dans un ensemble à plusieurs voix.

Nos existences sont autant faites des occasions manquées que des événements qui les ponctuent. Nul ne peut vivre toutes les virtualités qui étaient en lui, ni même les imaginer. Chaque instant qui passe laisse derrière soi une infinité de vies possibles qui n’ont tenu qu’à un souffle. Le hasard, ce que l’individu en fait, sa volonté de chance ou son abandon aux circonstances, dessinent des parcours personnels qui auraient pu être radicalement autres.

Ce sont des lieux où nul n’a plus de comptes à rendre, une suspension heureuse et joyeuse de soi, un détour qui ramène à soi après quelques heures ou quelques jours, ou davantage. Des moyens délibérés de retrouver sa vitalité, son intériorité, le goût de vivre.

A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not.

Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves.

And reminding myself of my own death repeatedly over the years—whether it be through meditation, through reading philosophy, or through doing crazy shit like standing on a cliff in South Africa—is the only thing that has helped me hold this realization front and center in my mind. This acceptance of my death, this understanding of my own fragility, has made everything easier—untangling my addictions, identifying and confronting my own entitlement, accepting responsibility for my own problems—suffering through my fears and uncertainties, accepting my failures and embracing rejections—it has all been made lighter by the thought of my own death.

Whatever gets loaded into a machine might be a replica of my consciousness, but it’s difficult to make any case that it is my consciousness, especially if I am still alive. The moment it gets uploaded, it would also become different and separate, and while it may “live” on after my death, it doesn’t do anything to deal with the fact that I still die.

as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialised in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilisation. With the development of machine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels.

According to what I called the Fitting Fulfillment View, a life is meaningful insofar as its subjective attractions are to things or goals that are objectively worthwhile. That is, one’s life is meaningful insofar as one finds oneself loving things worthy of love and able to do something positive about it.

elitism and parochialism are dangers that we need to be wary of, especially perhaps when making judgments about the relative value of what other people do with their lives. But we can minimize these dangers if we keep our fallibility in mind, if we regard our judgments as tentative, and if we remind ourselves, when necessary, that the object of thinking about the category of meaningfulness in life is not to produce a meaningfulness scale for ranking lives.

Whereas worries about elitism call our attention to the dangers of thinking one knows which things, activities, or projects have value, the second set of concerns, more purely philosophical, raises questions about the idea that there is such a thing as an objective standard of value at all, or more precisely, an objective standard that distinguishes some projects, activities, and interests from others as being more fitting for or more capable of contributing to the meaningfulness of one’s life.

Rather than continue the search for a single term to name an attitude or psychological condition that any meaningful life must involve, it might be wiser, if less satisfyingly determinate, simply to acknowledge that there is a range of such attitudes and conditions, which includes love and fulfillment, and which reflects the kind of intentional, but also qualitatively positive, attachment to an object or activity that an agent must have in order for engagement with it to contribute to the meaningfulness of his life.

What is so good about doing what it is in one’s nature to do? Does it matter what kind of nature one has? Does it matter, for example, whether one’s nature is peaceable or belligerent, creative or imitative, social or solitary? These questions are especially pressing if we identify fulfillment with meaningfulness.

By focusing on one activity or project at a time, or on lives that are predominantly bound up with a single project, we were able to illustrate and test our ideas more clearly and more vividly than if we had discussed lives that were, or were noticed to be, more complex and varied. But most lives are more complex and varied.

As an activity or practice gains recognition and popularity, as traditions develop and groups organize around it, the opportunities for valuable activities involving it multiply: one can not only play basketball, one can coach it, teach it, write about it. Even being a fan can be a strand in the fabric that connects one to others, supplying a ready topic of conversation or just a knowing bond that links one to one’s neighbors or one’s community.

In arguing that meaningfulness is a distinctive dimension of a good life, different from both happiness and moral goodness, and that the concept of meaningfulness is essentially tied to a commitment to objective distinctions in value, I have tried to show the importance of keeping the vocabulary of meaningfulness and value alive, and of not assimilating or reducing these terms to others that we are more comfortable with in both philosophy and popular culture.

Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What’s the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analyzing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids’ brain cells.

It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.

Malgré tout mon scepticisme, il m’est resté un peu de superstition irrationnelle, telle cette curieuse conviction que tout événement qui m’advient comporte en plus un sens, qu’il signifie quelque chose ; que par sa propre histoire la vie nous parle, nous révèle graduellement un secret, qu’elle s’offre comme un rébus à déchiffrer, que les histoires que nous vivons forment en même temps une mythologie de notre vie et que cette mythologie détient la clé de la vérité et du mystère.

What these students could expect at one of Epictetus’s lectures was not a one-way communication, from Epictetus to his students, about esoteric philosophical theories. To the contrary, he wanted his students to take his lectures personally. He wanted his remarks to strike close to home. He therefore told his students that a Stoic school should be like a physician’s consulting room and that patients should leave feeling bad rather than feeling good,22 the idea being that any treatment likely to cure a patient is also likely to cause him discomfort.

According to Epictetus, the primary concern of philosophy should be the art of living: Just as wood is the medium of the carpenter and bronze is the medium of the sculptor, your life is the medium on which you practice the art of living.

ANY THOUGHTFUL PERSON will periodically contemplate the bad things that can happen to him. The obvious reason for doing this is to prevent those things from happening.

Seneca therefore points to a second reason for contemplating the bad things that can happen to us. If we think about these things, we will lessen their impact on us when, despite our efforts at prevention, they happen:

there is a third and arguably much more important reason. We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.

The problem, though, is that once they fulfill a desire for something, they adapt to its presence in their life and as a result stop desiring it—or at any rate, don’t find it as desirable as they once did. They end up just as dissatisfied as they were before fulfilling the desire.

One key to happiness, then, is to forestall the adaptation process: We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking for granted, once we get them, the things we worked so hard to get.

A practicing Stoic will keep the trichotomy of control firmly in mind as he goes about his daily affairs. He will perform a kind of triage in which he sorts the elements of his life into three categories: those over which he has complete control, those over which he has no control at all, and those over which he has some but not complete control. The things in the second category—those over which he has no control at all—he will set aside as not worth worrying about. In doing this, he will spare himself a great deal of needless anxiety. He will instead concern himself with things over which he has complete control and things over which he has some but not complete control. And when he concerns himself with things in this last category, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals for himself and will thereby avoid a considerable amount of frustration and disappointment.

Suppose, however, that I don’t respect the source of an insult; indeed, suppose that I take him to be a thoroughly contemptible individual. Under such circumstances, rather than feeling hurt by his insults, I should feel relieved: If he disapproves of what I am doing, then what I am doing is doubtless the right thing to do.

Nothing is more pathetic, after all, than a person who, a day after being insulted, walks up to the person who insulted him, reminds him of what the insult was, and then gives his reply to it. The Stoics realized this and as a result advocated a second way to respond to insults: with no response at all.

Advocates of politically correct speech therefore petition the authorities—government officials, employers, and school administrators—to punish anyone who insults a disadvantaged individual. Epictetus would reject this manner of dealing with insults as being woefully counterproductive. He would point out, to begin with, that the political correctness movement has some untoward side effects. One is that the process of protecting disadvantaged individuals from insults will tend to make them hypersensitive to insults:

Although the strategy of gaining happiness by working to get whatever it is we find ourselves wanting is obvious and has been used by most people throughout recorded history and across cultures, it has an important defect, as thoughtful people throughout recorded history and across cultures have realized: For each desire we fulfill in accordance with this strategy, a new desire will pop into our head to take its place. This means that no matter how hard we work to satisfy our desires, we will be no closer to satisfaction than if we had fulfilled none of them.

Among their recommendations were the following: • We should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reflect on how we responded to the day’s events. How did we respond to an insult? To the loss of a possession? To a stressful situation? Did we, in our responses, put Stoic psychological strategies to work? • We should use our reasoning ability to overcome negative emotions. We should also use our reasoning ability to master our desires, to the extent that it is possible to do so. In particular, we should use reason to convince ourselves that things such as fame and fortune aren’t worth having—not, at any rate, if what we seek is tranquility—and therefore aren’t worth pursuing. Likewise, we should use our reasoning ability to convince ourselves that even though certain activities are pleasurable, engaging in those activities will disrupt our tranquility, and the tranquility lost will outweigh the pleasure gained. • If, despite not having pursued wealth, we find ourselves wealthy, we should enjoy our affluence; it was the Cynics, not the Stoics, who advocated asceticism. But although we should enjoy wealth, we should not cling to it; indeed, even as we enjoy it, we should contemplate its loss. • We are social creatures; we will be miserable if we try to cut off contact with other people. Therefore, if what we seek is tranquility, we should form and maintain relations with others. In doing so, though, we should be careful about whom we befriend. We should also, to the extent possible, avoid people whose values are corrupt, for fear that their values will contaminate ours. • Other people are invariably annoying, though, so if we maintain relations with them, they will periodically upset our tranquility—if we let them. The Stoics spent a considerable amount of time devising techniques for taking the pain out of our relationships with other people. In particular, they came up with techniques for dealing with the insults of others and preventing them from angering us. • The Stoics pointed to two principal sources of human unhappiness—our insatiability and our tendency to worry about things beyond our control—and they developed techniques for removing these sources of unhappiness from our life. • To conquer our insatiability, the Stoics advise us to engage in negative visualization. We should contemplate the impermanence of all things. We should imagine ourselves losing the things we most value, including possessions and loved ones. We should also imagine the loss of our own life. If we do this, we will come to appreciate the things we now have, and because we appreciate them, we will be less likely to form desires for other things. And besides simply imagining that things could be worse than they are, we should sometimes cause things to be worse than they would otherwise be; Seneca advises us to “practice poverty,” and Musonius advises us voluntarily to forgo opportunities for pleasure and comfort. • To curb our tendency to worry about things beyond our control, the Stoics advise us to perform a kind of triage with respect to the elements of our life and sort them into those we have no control over, those we have complete control over, and those we have some but not complete control over. Having done this, we should not bother about things over which we have no control. Instead, we should spend some of our time dealing with things over which we have complete control, such as our goals and values, and spend most of our time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control. If we do this, we will avoid experiencing much needless anxiety. • When we spend time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control, we should be careful to internalize our goals. My goal in playing tennis, for example, should be not to win the match but to play the best match possible. • We should be fatalistic with respect to the external world: We should realize that what has happened to us in the past and what is happening to us at this very moment are beyond our control, so it is foolish to get upset about these things.

Why does the theory of evolution provoke such objections, whereas nobody seems to care about the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics? How come politicians don’t ask that kids be exposed to alternative theories about matter, energy, space and time? After all, Darwin’s ideas seem at first sight far less threatening than the monstrosities of Einstein and Werner Heisenberg. The theory of evolution rests on the principle of the survival of the fittest, which is a clear and simple – not to say humdrum – idea. In contrast, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics argue that you can twist time and space, that something can appear out of nothing, and that a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time. This makes a mockery of our common sense, yet nobody seeks to protect innocent schoolchildren from these scandalous ideas.

They are ‘dividuals’.

Jazz has usually been thought of as a group activity, born of the interaction between musicians in the moment of performance. The manner in which musicians interact while performing not only is an important stylistic component of jazz but can come to be part of a larger narrative of musical progress. Perhaps for this reason solo playing has been relegated to a footnote in jazz history, subservient to a narrative in which ensembles dominate.

Taken together then, what do these examples from the Corea and Jarrett albums say about form? Both records contain a number of pieces with conventional cyclical forms, suggesting that the musicians were not entirely rejecting the postbop model of song form, and indeed were quite happy to work within that model. At the same time, many of the pieces on the albums suggested a new relationship between improviser and form, and a new way of conceptualizing composition.

Whereas a composer can choose to craft a piece in a variety of ways, not working in a linear fashion but shaping segments one at a time, and revising previously written material, an improviser is locked into a temporality in which material cannot be revised once it is played.1

Perhaps it is the case that a quality of liveness emerges from the recording as a result of how listeners are inclined to share in this temporality with the improviser, to hear the music as it is being created and to understand it as such.

There is a considerable amount of reverberation added to the recording.

these vocalizations are sometimes parallel to, and in tune with, the musical line, while at other times they are parallel but out of tune.11 Vocalizing along with lines like this has an important effect: not only does it help convey for the listener the physical effort involved in improvising, but it also makes an implicit association with singing.

This sense of non intention is contributed to by Jarrett’s seeming to stumble onto this A major chord, and then after hearing it, repeating it again and again.

Tesser’s review serves to confirm that Jarrett’s music was heard, by some listeners, in terms of a non-Western aesthetic. A certain kind of musical stasis, executed by means of harmonically immobile vamp passages, was part of a more general cultural potential music could possess to evoke altered states of consciousness

Pedal noise is a device he uses deliberately elsewhere. In this case the noise is not of a sufficient volume to be audible above the notes, but it functions in auditory terms almost like a bass drum, placed low in the mix, articulating the four beats of the meter. It is also placed slightly ahead of the beat, having the effect of propelling the music by anticipating the beat.

This kind of binary opposition is deeply flawed, not least because many improvisers prepare for what they do, and many composers create musical fragments or even whole pieces with the same speed as improvisers.

I have been keen to suggest that this record came to stand for something, to function in variety of ways as a symbol of an idealized spontaneous creativity, an acoustic music free from the trappings of electronics. We can see at this point how those conceptions can become something rather different. The use of the record as background music emphasizes its potential functionality. The recording itself is not so important; more significant are the opportunities it affords its listeners.

The Köln Concert sits on a kind of aesthetic faultline. On the one side, its invocation of the improvisatory ideal places it within a jazz tradition that valorizes the importance of the spontaneous performance over the methodical and carefully rehearsed approach, even at the risk of idealizing this aesthetic to the point of distortion. But on the other, the history of the record’s associations in the 1970s as a “coffee table” item, relegating it to the status of background music, and then in some of the usages discussed previously, suggests that it is something jazz records are not expected to be.

Un de mes frères attrapa le tétanos et mourut. On s'ennuyait épouvantablement, tous les jours ressemblaient au dimanche ; dans la rue les gens marchaient sérieusement, verticalement, et sur la plage, ils se déshabillaient, se baignaient, se noyaient, se sauvaient, se rhabillaient et se congratulaient avec une désolante ponctualité ; tout s'en mêlait, le pain sur le paillasson, le monsieur qui vient pour le gaz et les cloches pour les morts, pour ceux qui se marient.

Packing Your Bags FOR HER •  A favorite picture and/or anything else she might need or want to help her through labor and the birth. •  A battery-operated CD or MP3 player and some favorite music to help you both relax during labor. I know this sounds so twentieth century, but some hospitals may not allow you to plug anything, including chargers, into their outlets. •  A bathrobe, a nightgown, or even one of your old T-shirts that she won’t mind getting a little blood on. Or a lot. •  A large sports bottle (you know, the kind with the built-in straw) for sipping clear liquids. •  Warm, nonskid socks and/or old slippers (hospital floors can be slippery). Again, ones she won’t mind getting bloody. •  A change of clothes to go home in—not what she was wearing before she got pregnant. Sweats or maternity pants are particularly good. •  A nursing bra. •  Her toiletries bag. Don’t forget things like mouthwash, toothbrush and toothpaste, glasses, contact lens paraphernalia, hairbrush or comb, and a headband or ponytail holder or two. •  Leave the jewelry at home. FOR YOU •  Comfortable clothes. •  Your e-reader or some magazines and a collection of your partner’s favorite short stories to read to her. •  A swimsuit (you might want to get into the shower with your partner, and the nursing staff might be surprised at the sight of a naked man). •  A camera, plenty of batteries, and memory cards or film. •  This book. •  A cooler filled with snacks. This is not for your partner. (She shouldn’t be eating while she’s in labor, but you’ll need to keep your energy up.) You’re not going to want to leave your partner, mid-contraction, to run down to the hospital cafeteria. If you have some extra room, bring along a small birthday cake and maybe even some Champagne for afterward. •  Cash. For vending machines, parking meters, cab rides, and so on. •  Chargers for your phone, tablet, MP3 player, and any other electronic gadgets you’re planning to bring with you. •  Tennis balls for back rubs. •  A toothbrush, extra underwear, shaving kit, and the like. You’ll probably end up staying at least one night. FOR THE BABY •  An infant car seat (if you don’t have one, the hospital won’t let you leave). And make sure it’s been properly installed. •  A little outfit to go home in—a sleeper or sleep sac is fine, just as long as it has legs so the car seat’s harness can go between them. (It’s a good idea to wash all new clothes before putting them on the baby.) •  Diapers. •  Several receiving blankets, weather-appropriate. •  Warm blankets for the ride home.

If you had been quietly observing Earth around the time when life got started, you would have noticed a dramatic change in goal-oriented behavior. Whereas earlier, the particles seemed as though they were trying to increase average messiness in various ways, these newly ubiquitous self-copying patterns seemed to have a different goal: not dissipation but replication.

Some recent NCC research suggests that your consciousness mainly resides in a “hot zone” involving the thalamus (near the middle of your brain) and the rear part of the cortex (the outer brain layer consisting of a crumpled-up six-layer sheet which, if flattened out, would have the area of a large dinner napkin).12 This same research controversially suggests that the primary visual cortex at the very back of the head is an exception to this, being as unconscious as your eyeballs and your retinas.

If consciousness is the way that information feels when it’s processed in certain ways, then it must be substrate-independent; it’s only the structure of the information processing that matters, not the structure of the matter doing the information processing.

One issue here is that of giving up many of the great plans one had earlier in life, which one can now see are forms of naïveté or vanity that distort and deform one’s appreciation of the present moment. Giving up such plans can seem – and is – to some extent a loss, a capitulation to exigencies of life that one cannot have chosen, but it is also a form of release, a recognition that what really matters is the quality of one’s inner life, which has in many ways little to do with external or socially sanctioned achievements.

Just as one has to learn to cope with one’s own character, so one has to learn to cope with others’ characters. This is not to deny, of course, that one can affect others by being around them a fair bit, but it does mean, first, that it is pointless trying directly to change someone else and, secondly, that any effect one has on another is like the effect a gardener might have on a tree: it can grow in this or that direction under his influence, but all the basics of what it is are fixed and something over which he has no control.

At any rate, while I do not at all wish to over-romanticize how difficult it is to bring up children, I can see that there is a kind of nobility in doing so. In a way, it is part of (entering) what James Joyce, in his A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, called “the fair courts of life”. Moreover, I see it as an expression of optimism: I think one reason people have children is that, having grasped the compromised nature of life, the desire to start a family is an expression of hope in better things. And beyond that there is something simply extraordinary in someone’s being born at all, wondrous in the fact that, as Arendt put it, human parents summon their children into life from the darkness.

Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict.

A worthy goal, so long as we understand that social glue, as opposed to creativity, is the principal benefit.

Many of the children turned out exactly as Kagan had expected. The high-reactive infants, the 20 percent who’d hollered at the mobiles bobbing above their heads, were more likely to have developed serious, careful personalities. The low-reactive infants—the quiet ones—were more likely to have become relaxed and confident types. High and low reactivity tended to correspond, in other words, to introversion and extroversion.

Often used as a way to conquer phobias, desensitization involves exposing yourself (and your amygdala) to the thing you’re afraid of over and over again, in manageable doses. This is very different from the well-meaning but unhelpful advice that you should just jump in at the deep end and try to swim—an approach that might work, but more likely will produce panic, further encoding in your brain a cycle of dread, fear, and shame

They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive (just as Aron’s husband had described her). They dream vividly, and can often recall their dreams the next day.

After the peak of your experience, as you are reentering your world, is often an excellent time to do personal work. You will be aware of your usual identity, but not be as attached to your usual habits, templates, or distortions. If you wish—and your guide agrees—this is also a good time to go outside. If there is no outdoor setting that is safe and inviting, you may enjoy observing a flower or plant in the room or even looking through large-format photography books about nature.

What if we have just been defining antidepressants in the wrong way? We have thought of antidepressants solely as the pills we swallow once (or more) a day. But what if we started to think of antidepressants as something very different? What if changing the way we live—in specific, targeted, evidence-based ways—could be seen as an antidepressant, too?

What we found out was that the love is there, the forgiveness is there, and the understanding and compassion are there. But like water to a fish or air to a bird, it is there, all around us, and exists without any effort on our part. There is no need for the Father, the Son, the Buddha, the Saints, the Torah, the books, the bells, the candles, the priests, the rituals, or even the wisdom. It is just there—so pervasive and so unending that it is impossible to see as long as you are in the smaller world of people separated from one another.

Although no formal research exists on sub-perceptual doses, a growing number of people have been using psychedelics this way. When people take a sub-perceptual amount—for LSD, about 10 micrograms (also known as a micro-dose, sub-dose, or “tener”)—the common sensory effects associated with higher doses of LSD or psilocybin—a glow or a sparkle around the edges of living things, sensory interweaving such as hearing in color or tasting music, and a loosening of ego boundaries—do not appear.

Our egos protect us. They guard us. They are necessary. But when they grow too big, they cut us off from the possibility of connection. Taking them down, then, isn’t something to be done casually.

You can pull the plug on the things that are fragmenting us—the junk values and the egotism they create—in many ways. Some people will do it with psychedelics; more people will do it with loving-kindness meditation—and we need to look at exploring many other techniques too.

What this suggests is it’s not just the childhood trauma in itself that causes these problems, including depression and anxiety—it’s hiding away the childhood trauma. It’s not telling anyone because you’re ashamed. When you lock it away in your mind, it festers, and the sense of shame grows.

They are all real, and none of these three can be described by something as crude as the idea of a chemical imbalance.

La vie se divise en trois temps: le présent, le passé et l'avenir. Le présent est court, l'avenir incertain; le passé seul est assuré: car sur lui la fortune a perdu ses droits; et il n'est au pouvoir de personne d'en disposer de nouveau.

On dit souvent qu'il n'a pas été en notre pouvoir de choisir nos parents; que le sort nous les a donnés. Il est pourtant une naissance qui dépend de nous. Il existe plusieurs familles d'illustres génies; choisissez celle où vous désirez être admis, vous y serez adopté, non seulement pour en prendre le nom, mais les biens, et vous ne serez point tenu de les conserver en homme avare et sordide; ils s'augmenteront au fur et à mesure que vous en ferez part à plus de monde.

La vie du sage est donc très étendue; elle n'est pas renfermée dans les bornes assignées au reste des mortels. Seul il est affranchi des lois du genre humain: tous les siècles lui sont soumis comme à Dieu: le temps passé, il en reste maître par le souvenir; le présent, il en use; l'avenir, il en jouit d'avance. Il se compose une longue vie par la réunion de tous les temps en un seul.

Tout ce que donne le hasard est peu stable; et plus il vous élève, plus haut il vous suspend au bord du précipice. Or, personne ne doit se complaire à des biens si fragiles.

Beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the early 1970s, psychedelic compounds had been used to treat a variety of conditions—including alcoholism, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety at the end of life—frequently with impressive results. But few of the studies were well controlled by modern standards, and some of them were compromised by the enthusiasm of the researchers involved.

It would then be reassuring to believe that killing on such a vast scale does not matter, because fish do not feel pain. But the nervous systems of fish are sufficiently similar to those of birds and mammals to suggest that they do. When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behavior may last several hours. (It is a myth that fish have short memories.) Fish learn to avoid unpleasant experiences, like electric shocks. And painkillers reduce the symptoms of pain that they would otherwise show.

The sheer suggestibility of psychedelics is one of their defining characteristics, so in one sense it is no wonder that so many of the first cohort of volunteers at Hopkins had powerful mystical experiences: the experiment was designed by three men intensely interested in mystical states of consciousness.

This last hypothesis about the invention of language turns on the concept of synesthesia, the conflation of the senses that psychedelics are known to induce: under the influence of psilocybin, numbers can take on colors, colors attach to sounds, and so on. Language, he contends, represents a special case of synesthesia, in which otherwise meaningless sounds become linked to concepts. Hence, the stoned ape: by giving us the gifts of language and self-reflection psilocybin mushrooms made us who we are, transforming our primate ancestors into Homo sapiens.

Even if psilocybin in mushrooms began as “an accident of a metabolic pathway,” the fact that it wasn’t discarded during the course of the species’ evolution suggests it must have offered some benefit. “My best guess,” Beug says, “is that the mushrooms that produced the most psilocybin got selectively eaten and so their spores got more widely disseminated.” Eaten by whom, or what? And why? Beug says that many animals are known to eat psilocybin mushrooms, including horses, cattle, and dogs. Some, like cows, appear unaffected, but many animals appear to enjoy an occasional change in consciousness

Critics of treating alcoholics with LSD concluded that the treatment didn’t work as well under rigorously controlled conditions, which was true enough, while supporters of the practice concluded that attention to set and setting was essential to the success of LSD therapy, which was also true. • • • IN THE MID-1950S, Bill Wilson, the cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, learned about Osmond and Hoffer’s work with alcoholics. The idea that a drug could occasion a life-changing spiritual experience was not exactly news to Bill W., as he was known in the fellowship. He credited his own sobriety to a mystical experience he had on belladonna, a plant-derived alkaloid with hallucinogenic properties that was administered to him at Towns Hospital in Manhattan in 1934. Few members of AA realize that the whole idea of a spiritual awakening leading one to surrender to a “higher power”—a cornerstone of Alcoholics Anonymous—can be traced to a psychedelic drug trip.

Normally, rites of passage help knit societies together as the young cross over hurdles and through gates erected and maintained by their elders, coming out on the other side to take their place in the community of adults. Not so with the psychedelic journey in the 1960s, which at its conclusion dropped its young travelers onto a psychic landscape unrecognizable to their parents.

In the case of the incest taboo, our response has an obvious evolutionary explanation. But should we allow our judgment of what is a crime to be determined by feelings of repugnance that may have strengthened the evolutionary fitness of ancestors who lacked effective contraception?

Video games are properly subject to legal controls, not when they enable people to do things that, if real, would be crimes, but when there is evidence on the basis of which we can reasonably conclude that they are likely to increase serious crime in the real world. At present, the evidence for that is stronger for games involving violence than it is for virtual realities that permit pedophilia

In his introduction to The Secret Chief Revealed, Myron Stolaroff sketched the influence of underground guides like Leo Zeff on the field as a whole, suggesting that the legitimate psychedelic research that resumed in the late 1990s, when he was writing, had “evolved as a result of anecdotal evidence from underground therapists” like Zeff, as well as from the first wave of psychedelic research done in the 1950s and 1960s.

Members of this community tend to be more spiritual than religious in any formal sense, focused on the common core of mysticism or “cosmic consciousness” that they believe lies behind all the different religious traditions. So what appeared to me as a bunch of conflicting symbols of divinity are in fact different means of expressing or interpreting the same underlying spiritual reality, “the perennial philosophy” that Aldous Huxley held to undergird all religions and to which psychedelics supposedly can offer direct access.

We tend to think of charity as something that is “morally optional”—good to do, but not wrong to fail to do. As long as one does not kill, maim, steal, cheat, and so on, one can be a morally virtuous citizen, even if one spends lavishly and gives nothing to charity. But those who have enough to spend on luxuries, yet fail to share even a tiny fraction of their income with the poor, must bear some responsibility for the deaths they could have prevented.

On the contrary, Kahneman and his colleagues found that people with higher incomes spent more time in activities that are associated with negative feelings, such as tension and stress. Instead of having more time for leisure, they spent more time at and commuting to work. They were more often in moods that they described as hostile, angry, anxious, and tense.

In an article published in Science on June 30, they report that their data confirm that there is little correlation between income and happiness. On the contrary, Kahneman and his colleagues found that people with higher incomes spent more time in activities that are associated with negative feelings, such as tension and stress. Instead of having more time for leisure, they spent more time at and commuting to work. They were more often in moods that they described as hostile, angry, anxious, and tense.

The group of tryptamines we call “the classic psychedelics” have a strong affinity with one particular type of serotonin receptor, called the 5-HT2A. These receptors are found in large numbers in the human cortex, the outermost, and evolutionarily most recent, layer of the brain. Basically, the psychedelics resemble serotonin closely enough that they can attach themselves to this receptor site in such a way as to activate it to do various things.

This has led some scientists to speculate that the human body must produce some other, more bespoke chemical for the express purpose of activating the 5-HT2A receptor—perhaps an endogenous psychedelic that is released under certain circumstances, perhaps when dreaming. One candidate for that chemical is the psychedelic molecule DMT, which has been found in trace amounts in the pineal gland of rats.

True, anesthetics disrupt consciousness too, yet because such drugs shut it down, this kind of disturbance yields relatively little data. In contrast, someone on a psychedelic remains awake and able to report on what he or she is experiencing in real time. Nowadays, these subjective reports can be correlated with various measures of brain activity, using several different modes of imaging—tools unavailable to researchers during the first wave of psychedelic research in the 1950s and 1960s.

A better way to suppress uncertainty and entropy in the human brain emerged with the evolution of the default mode network, Carhart-Harris contends, a brain-regulating system that is absent or undeveloped in lower animals and young children. Along with the default mode network, “a coherent sense of self or ‘ego’ emerges” and, with that, the human capacity for self-reflection and reason.

Baby consciousness is so different from adult consciousness as to constitute a mental country of its own, one from which we are expelled sometime early in adolescence. Is there a way back in? The closest we can come to visiting that foreign land as adults may be during the psychedelic journey.

In The Philosophical Baby, Gopnik draws a useful distinction between the “spotlight consciousness” of adults and the “lantern consciousness” of young children. The first mode gives adults the ability to narrowly focus attention on a goal. (In his own remarks, Carhart-Harris called this “ego consciousness” or “consciousness with a point.”) In the second mode—lantern consciousness—attention is more widely diffused, allowing the child to take in information from virtually anywhere in her field of awareness, which is quite wide, wider than that of most adults. (By this measure, children are more conscious than adults, rather than less.)

A low-temperature search (so-called because it requires less energy) involves reaching for the most probable or nearest-to-hand answer, like the one that worked for a similar problem in the past. Low-temperature searches succeed more often than not. A high-temperature search requires more energy because it involves reaching for less likely but possibly more ingenious and creative answers—those found outside the box of preconception. Drawing on its wealth of experience, the adult mind performs low-temperature searches most of the time.

Gopnik believes that both the young child (five and under) and the adult on a psychedelic have a stronger predilection for the high-temperature search; in their quest to make sense of things, their minds explore not just the nearby and most likely but “the entire space of possibilities.” These high-temperature searches might be inefficient, incurring a higher rate of error and requiring more time and mental energy to perform. High-temperature searches can yield answers that are more magical than realistic. Yet there are times when hot searches are the only way to solve a problem, and occasionally they return answers of surpassing beauty and originality.

Matt Johnson refers to these realizations as “duh moments” and says they are common among his volunteers and not at all insignificant. Smokers know perfectly well that their habit is unhealthy, disgusting, expensive, and unnecessary, but under the influence of psilocybin that knowing acquires a new weight, becomes “something they feel in the gut and the heart. Insights like this become more compelling, stickier, and harder to avoid thinking about. These sessions deprive people of the luxury of mindlessness”—our default state, and one in which addictions like smoking can flourish.

“So much of human suffering stems from having this self that needs to be psychologically defended at all costs. We’re trapped in a story that sees ourselves as independent, isolated agents acting in the world. But that self is an illusion. It can be a useful illusion, when you’re swinging through the trees or escaping from a cheetah or trying to do your taxes. But at the systems level, there is no truth to it. You can take any number of more accurate perspectives: that we’re a swarm of genes, vehicles for passing on DNA; that we’re social creatures through and through, unable to survive alone; that we’re organisms in an ecosystem, linked together on this planet floating in the middle of nowhere. Wherever you look, you see that the level of interconnectedness is truly amazing, and yet we insist on thinking of ourselves as individual agents.”

Leary. It could well be that the current enthusiasm will eventually give way to a more modest assessment of their potential. New treatments always look shiniest and most promising at the beginning. In early studies with small samples, the researchers, who are usually biased in favor of finding an effect, have the luxury of selecting the volunteers most likely to respond. Because their number is so small, these volunteers benefit from the care and attention of exceptionally well-trained and dedicated therapists, who are also biased in favor of success. Also, the placebo effect is usually strongest in a new medicine and tends to fade over time, as observed in the case of antidepressants; they don’t work nearly as well today as they did upon their introduction in the 1980s.

A happy brain is a supple and flexible brain, he believes; depression, anxiety, obsession, and the cravings of addiction are how it feels to have a brain that has become excessively rigid or fixed in its pathways and linkages—a brain with more order than is good for it. On the spectrum he lays out (in his entropic brain article) ranging from excessive order to excessive entropy, depression, addiction, and disorders of obsession all fall on the too-much-order end.

Carhart-Harris uses the metaphor of annealing from metallurgy: psychedelics introduce energy into the system, giving it the flexibility necessary for it to bend and so change. The Hopkins researchers use a similar metaphor to make the same point: psychedelic therapy creates an interval of maximum plasticity in which, with proper guidance, new patterns of thought and behavior can be learned.

When the ego dissolves, so does a bounded conception not only of our self but of our self-interest. What emerges in its place is invariably a broader, more openhearted and altruistic—that is, more spiritual—idea of what matters in life.

After each of my psychedelic sessions came a period of several weeks in which I felt noticeably different—more present to the moment, much less inclined to dwell on what’s next. I was also notably more emotional and surprised myself on several occasions by how little it took to make me tear up or smile. I found myself thinking about things like death and time and infinity, but less in angst than in wonder.

In some environmental circles, blanket opposition to GMOs is like taking a loyalty oath—dissidents are regarded as traitors in league with the evil biotech industry. It is time to move beyond such a narrowly ideological stance. Some GMOs may have a useful role to play in public health, and others in fighting the challenge of growing food in an era of climate change. We should consider the merits of each genetically modified plant on a case-by-case basis.

Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders. With the passing of generations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each other. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their human companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to survive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead dogs were even buried ceremoniously, much like humans.

Trekkers visiting the Siberian tundra, the deserts of central Australia and the Amazonian rainforest believe that they have entered pristine landscapes, virtually untouched by human hands. But that’s an illusion. The foragers were there before us and they brought about dramatic changes even in the densest jungles and the most desolate wildernesses.

The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias.

The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions. Yet why should individuals care about this evolutionary calculus? Why would any sane person lower his or her standard of living just to multiply the number of copies of the Homo sapiens genome? Nobody agreed to this deal: the Agricultural Revolution was a trap.

It offered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and well-nourished people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat fields, the oasis supported a large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.

The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.

So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil.

Biologists have since debunked Nazi racial theory. In particular, genetic research conducted after 1945 has demonstrated that the differences between the various human lineages are far smaller than the Nazis postulated. But these conclusions are relatively new. Given the state of scientific knowledge in 1933, Nazi beliefs were hardly outside the pale. The existence of different human races, the superiority of the white race, and the need to protect and cultivate this superior race were widely held beliefs among most Western elites.

Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. They pass their entire lives as cogs in a giant production line, and the length and quality of their existence is determined by the profits and losses of business corporations. Even when the industry takes care to keep them alive, reasonably healthy and well fed, it has no intrinsic interest in the animals’ social and psychological needs (except when these have a direct impact on production).

On est puceau de l'Horreur comme on l'est de la volupté. Comment aurais-je pu me douter moi de cette horreur en quittant la place Clichy ? Qui aurait pu prévoir avant d'entrer vraiment dans la guerre, tout ce que contenait la sale âme héroïque et fainéante des hommes ? À présent, j'étais pris dans cette fuite en masse, vers le meurtre en commun, vers le feu... Ça venait des profondeurs et c'était arrivé.

NREM sleep received further dissection in the years thereafter, being subdivided into four separate stages, unimaginatively named NREM stages 1 to 4 (we sleep researchers are a creative bunch), increasing in their depth. Stages 3 and 4 are therefore the deepest stages of NREM sleep you experience, with “depth” being defined as the increasing difficulty required to wake an individual out of NREM stages 3 and 4, compared with NREM stages 1 or 2.

As we will discover in chapter 6, a key function of deep NREM sleep, which predominates early in the night, is to do the work of weeding out and removing unnecessary neural connections. In contrast, the dreaming stage of REM sleep, which prevails later in the night, plays a role in strengthening those connections.

From these clues, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of evolution’s lofty pyramid. At least two features define human beings relative to other primates. I posit that both have been beneficially and causally shaped by the hand of sleep, and specifically our intense degree of REM sleep relative to all other mammals: (1) our degree of sociocultural complexity, and (2) our cognitive intelligence. REM sleep, and the act of dreaming itself, lubricates both of these human traits.

The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen hours. After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours. Three full nights of recovery sleep (i.e., more nights than a weekend) are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping. Finally, the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.

No matter what you may have heard or read in the popular media, there is no scientific evidence we have suggesting that a drug, a device, or any amount of psychological willpower can replace sleep. Power naps may momentarily increase basic concentration under conditions of sleep deprivation, as can caffeine up to a certain dose. But in the subsequent studies that Dinges and many other researchers (myself included) have performed, neither naps nor caffeine can salvage more complex functions of the brain, including learning, memory, emotional stability, complex reasoning, or decision-making.

This was the theory of overnight therapy.

You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.

The obvious methods involve reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, removing screen technology from the bedroom, and having a cool bedroom. In addition, patients must (1) establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, (2) go to bed only when sleepy and avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings, (3) never lie awake in bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns, (4) avoid daytime napping if you are having difficulty sleeping at night, (5) reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed, and (6) remove visible clockfaces from view in the bedroom, preventing clock-watching anxiety at night.

One brief note of caution regarding physical activity: try not to exercise right before bed. Body temperature can remain high for an hour or two after physical exertion. Should this occur too close to bedtime, it can be difficult to drop your core temperature sufficiently to initiate sleep due to the exercise-driven increase in metabolic rate.

Over time, we could intelligently curate a tailored thermal sleep environment that is personalized to the circadian rhythms of each individual occupant of each bedroom, departing from the unhelpful non-varying thermal backdrop that plagues the sleep of most people using standard home thermostats. Both these changes require no effort from an individual, and should hasten the speed of sleep onset, increase total sleep time, and even deepen NREM-sleep quality for all household members (as discussed in chapter 13). The second passive solution concerns electric light. Many of us suffer from overexposure to nighttime light, particularly blue-dominant LED light from our digital devices. This evening digital light suppresses melatonin and delays our sleep timing. What if we can turn that problem into a solution? Soon, we should be able to engineer LED bulbs with filters that can vary the wavelength of light that they emit, ranging from warm yellow colors less harmful to melatonin, to strong blue light that powerfully suppresses it. Paired with sleep trackers that can accurately characterize our personal biological rhythms, we can install these new bulbs throughout a home, all connected to the home network. The lightbulbs (and even other networked LED-screen devices, such as iPads) would be instructed to gradually dial down the harmful blue light in the home as the evening progresses, based on an individual’s (or set of individuals’) natural sleep-wake pattern. We could do this dynamically and seamlessly as individuals move from one room to the next in real time. Here again we can intelligently split the difference on the fly based on the biophysiological mix of whoever is in the room. In doing so, the users’ own brains and bodies, measured and translated through the wearables to the networked home, would synergistically regulate light and thus melatonin release that promotes, rather than impedes, optimal regulation of sleep for one and

regular, plentiful sleep, as we once knew a century ago. But to battle against rather than unite with technology is the wrong approach in my mind. For one thing, it’s a losing battle: we will never put that technological genie back into its bottle, nor do we need to. Instead, we can use this powerful tool to our advantage. Within three to five years, I am quite certain there will be commercially available, affordable devices that track an individual’s sleep and circadian rhythm with high accuracy. When that happens, we can marry these individual sleep trackers with the revolution of in-home networked devices like thermostats and lighting. Some are already trying to do this as I write. Two exciting possibilities unfold. First, such devices could compare the sleep of each family member in each separate bedroom with the temperature sensed in each room by the thermostat. Using common machine-learning algorithms applied over time, we should be able to intelligently teach the home thermostat what the thermal sweet spot is for each occupant in each bedroom, based on the biophysiology calculated by their sleep-tracking device (perhaps splitting the difference when there are two or more individuals per room). Granted there are many different factors that make for a good or bad night of sleep, but temperature is very much one of them. Better still, we could program a natural circadian lull and rise in temperature across the night that is in harmony with each body’s expectations, rather than the constant nighttime temperature set in most homes and apartments. Over time, we could intelligently curate a tailored thermal sleep environment that is personalized to the circadian rhythms of each individual occupant of each bedroom, departing from the unhelpful non-varying thermal backdrop that plagues the sleep of most people using standard home thermostats

A partir du chapitre IV à peu près, il oublie qu’il a mis en scène Salomon ; il cesse de prendre sa fable au sérieux. C’est bien lui qui parle pour son propre compte quand il nous raconte les malheurs qu’il a eus avec les femmes, les tristesses de sa vie solitaire, les peines qu’il s’est donnés pour faire fortune, les préoccupations qui l’obsèdent en ce qui touche ses héritiers.

Tout est vanité. » Tel est le résumé, vingt fois répété, de l’ouvrage. Le livre se compose d’une suite de petits paragraphes, dont chacun contient une observation, une façon d’envisager la vie humaine, dont la conclusion est l’universelle frivolité. Cette conclusion, l’auteur la tire des expériences les plus diverses. Il s’y complaît ; il en fait le rythme et le refrain de sa pensée. Le monde présente à ses yeux une série de phénomènes, toujours les mêmes et roulant les uns après les autres dans une sorte de cercle. Nul progrès. Le passé a ressemblé au présent ; le présent ressemble à ce que sera l’avenir. Le présent est mauvais, le passé ne valait pas mieux, l’avenir ne sera pas préférable. Toute tentative pour améliorer les choses humaines est chimérique, l’homme étant incurablement borné dans ses facultés et sa destinée. L’abus est éternel ; le mal qu’on avait cru supprimé reparaît sur-le-champ, plus envenimé qu’avant sa suppression.

Beaucoup de juifs, pour échapper à ce qu’une aussi courte destinée a d’attristant, disaient que l’homme se survit dans ses enfants ; à défaut d’enfants, on consolait l’eunuque en lui promettant un cippe funèbre[8] qui perpétuerait sa mémoire dans sa tribu. Cohélet est peu sensible à ces consolations enfantines. L’homme une fois mort, sa mémoire disparaît, et c’est comme s’il n’avait jamais été.

Cohélet, comme nous, fait de la tristesse avec de la joie et de la joie avec la tristesse ; il ne conclut pas, il se débat entre des contradictoires ; il aime la vie, tout en en voyant la vanité. Surtout, il ne pose jamais. Il ne se complaît pas dans l’effet qu’il produit ; il ne se regarde pas maudissant l’existence. Il est d’une parfaite sincérité en disant qu’il a tout trouvé frivole et creux. On aime à se le représenter comme un homme exquis et de bonnes manières, comme un ancêtre de quelque riche juif de Paris égaré en Judée du temps de Jésus et des Macchabées.

Simplicity did not affect the friends’ sense of status because, by distancing themselves from the values of Athens, they had ceased to judge themselves on a material basis. There was no need to be embarrassed by bare walls, and no benefit in showing off gold. Among a group of friends living outside the political and economic centre of the city, there was – in the financial sense – nothing to prove.

The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you can’t lick ’em, join ’em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else.

According to Strawson, it is matter that’s utterly mysterious, because we have no understanding of its intrinsic nature. And he has dubbed this “the hard problem of matter”:

This experiment tells us that light acts differently depending on whether or not it is being measured. Without a measurement, light acts like a wave; and when it is measured, it takes on the characteristics of individual particles. Some have made the claim that in order for light to behave like particles, not only does a measurement have to be made but that measurement has to be consciously observed. I’m not sure how anyone can definitively state that consciousness is implicated in the strangeness of the double-slit experiment, and here I follow the overwhelming consensus among scientists, including Wheeler: that photons exist in many possible states at once until interacting with something, but the something needn’t be a conscious something. (This would change, of course, if we were to discover that consciousness is fundamental to matter, as consciousness would then be associated with all measurement, by definition.) As if these results weren’t strange enough, Wheeler introduced the element of time and made the prediction that even if we perform such a measurement after a photon has passed through one of the slits, we would still get the same effect, causing the photon to act like a particle retroactively.3 In other words, he predicted that a measurement in the present would mysteriously influence the past. This is the delayed-choice experiment, and it was finally conducted in 2007, confirming Wheeler’s prediction.4

The important point to remember is that Socratic happiness was about self-questioning and about appreciating the reality of an unseen world that lies beyond the physical realm. We might glimpse it through a process of contemplation and self-realisation. Happiness was indistinguishable from a rising above, a virtuous elevation, a higher plateau.

Where Plato pointed to a purified, shimmering ideal of Reason (we remember how he said that the concepts that touch us in our daily lives are tawdry reflections of a pure, idealised version of the true Ideas that exist on a higher plane), Epicurus tells us we have nothing more than our animalistic bodily senses to put to use.

Stoics taught, along with the Epicureans, that we should limit our desires, and that perceived problems in life are due to errors in judgement about those problems. If we change our attitude, the pain of those external factors can disappear. This may sound familiar to modern minds acquainted with the notion of ‘reframing’ a problem as an opportunity, and it is one of the Stoics’ most powerful and prevailing ideas.

One important new idea that emerged from Marx for our purposes is as follows: we saw work as an activity that was supposed to endow us with happiness and a sense of humanity. This was a strange new concept, and although it sprang up as a reaction against capitalism, there is no doubt that it is now part of the capitalist creed.

Seneca recommended that we mentally rehearse losing everything we have – family and property – to learn to value them more and be ready for when fortune strikes and they are taken from us. In fact, he went so far as to say we should, every now and then, purposefully go without the luxuries in our lives and live for a day here and there as a pauper, estranged from people and things that bring us comfort, in order to soften the blow should we ever find ourselves destitute.

Meanwhile, the human Mary’s situation is more compelling. Does she really learn something new when she steps out? Possibly, but a number of philosophers have argued that she does not. If she were truly possessed with the full extent of physical knowledge of colour, argues the philosopher Daniel Dennett, such knowledge would include an understanding of how and why our neurology would give us the experience of qualia. Nothing new would be acquired when stepping out. Others have argued that she might gain a new ability when seeing a colour for the first time (to recognise it, imagine it or remember it) but that it’s not correct to say that she has learnt any new knowledge. These intricate counter-arguments support physicalism and undermine the soul-defender’s case.

Religions sprang from highly charged moments in history that, at the time, connected people with a powerful sense of the transcendent. Certain suffused images spontaneously arose from these original events and gave people a pathway to a deep and vital sense of mystery. A culture would have assembled itself around these symbols and celebrated the force they still held, but over time of course this potency and import were lost. Later, with the original experience long gone from human memory, the culture came to create formal rituals or dogmas in an attempt to offer a symbolic connection to what made it so vibrant at the start. Eventually, the immediate, resonant experience of the transcendent was reduced to a mere belief and a set of practices. History was then rewritten and miracles and teachings ascribed to the hero saviour, who, instead of remaining a signpost to the transcendent, became himself the misplaced focus of worship.

Epicurus is pointing out to us a common mistake he thinks we make: that we tend to imagine ourselves as dead (rotting in the ground and so on) and feel fear or revulsion. But he says this is a silly error: we will have neither that experience of decomposition, nor of the flames of the crematorium. By the time it happens, we simply won’t exist.

How is it bad for her if she’s not around to experience being dead? Perhaps it’s not enough just to say that a thing is harmful, we also need to say when it is. Epicurus is saying that death and the harm it’s supposed to cause would have to happen at the same time. For this girl’s early death to be bad for her, we have to allow for the harm of death to happen while she’s alive.

You now suffer the devastating experience of realising you have been not only cheated on but also been made a figure of ridicule.

Yet, rather like the earlier Epicurean point that you won’t be around to experience death when it happens, Lucretius’s symmetry argument is somehow not entirely satisfying. Few of us are likely to throw up our hands, roll our eyes and cry ‘Of course!’ vowing never again to consider death a negative.

we feel very differently about pain that has happened in the past and pain that is yet to come. Pain we prefer to be behind us, and positive experiences in our future. We have a certain ‘future bias’ that means we care more about what’s yet to happen. An abyss of nothingness ahead of us, then, is not the same to us as one that’s been and gone in the past.

Lucretius is trying to answer the deprivation account of death by pointing out that we don’t feel deprived of the time we could have lived before we were born. But here is a difference: the deprivation that comes with death is something we can imagine. We know what we’re being deprived of: grandchildren, our home, our loving relationships, even that sense of I that enjoys those things. It stings in a way that the prenatal abyss does not.

While working intensively over a ten-year period with patients facing death from cancer, I found that many of them, rather than succumb to numbing despair, were positively and dramatically transformed. They rearranged their life priorities by trivialising life’s trivia. They assumed the power to choose not to do the things that they really did not wish to do. They communicated more deeply with those they loved, and appreciated more keenly the elemental facts of life – the changing seasons, the beauty of nature, the last Christmas or New Year. Many reported a diminishment of their fears of other people, a greater willingness to take risks, and less concern about rejection.

In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. We seek to understand each one and appreciate its efforts to help us, without losing sight of the ways it is causing problems. We develop a relationship of caring and trust with each part, and then take steps to heal it so it can function in a healthy way.

We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. You remain calm and unruffled, even in difficult circumstances.

Exercise: Accessing a Part that Isn’t Activated Pick one of your parts that isn’t activated right now. Imagine that you are in a situation in which the part is activated and notice how that feels. From that place, try accessing the part using each of the channels—feeling, body, image, and internal voice. Write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says However, remember that it isn’t necessary to achieve access through all channels.

Exercise: Noticing a Part in Real Time Choose a part that is activated with some frequency in your life that you want to learn more about. Over the next week, you will practice noticing when this part is activated. First think about which cues that will tip you off that it is activated. What body sensations, thoughts, or emotions will let you know it is up? For example, a tight stomach, revenge fantasies, or feeling teary like a child. What behavior will cue you that the part has taken over? For example, withdrawing from your partner, taking over a conversation, or eating too much. What situations or people tend to activate this part? For example, meeting someone you are attracted to, giving a talk, or being disobeyed by your son. When are these likely to occur during the next week? Set an intention to be especially aware of whether this part becomes activated during those times. Each time you notice the part is triggered, access it briefly and take down brief notes about it. If you can’t stop at the moment to make notes, do it at your next break or as soon as you can. You want it to be fresh in your memory. At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part Don’t expect perfection. You probably won’t catch all the times this issue is activated or be clear about what is going on each time. That is very difficult to do. You may be driving or trying to get a project finished or talking with someone, for example, so it may be difficult to be aware of much else. That is fine. Just do the best you can.

Exercise: Unblending from the Target Part Do a short IFS session with a part that is blended with you at the time. There are three ways to do this: When you are starting the session, see if there is a part blended with you. Choose that as your target part. If there is a part that is blended with you a lot and you know what external events tend to trigger it, arrange to do a session on a day when it is likely to be activated and blended with you. Do a session on the spur of the moment when a part is blended with you. Practice unblending as discussed in this chapter. Then go ahead and get to know the part a little. Ask what it is feeling or what it is concerned about. Ask it what it wants you to know about itself. If you are working with a partner, do this exercise with your partner. See Chapter 16 for advice on how to do this. You may also want to try it on your own.

Exercise: Daily Parts Check-In For the next week, take a little time each day to check in with your parts. Notice which parts are activated at that moment as you learned to do in Chapter 4. By doing this regularly, you will get used to paying attention to your inner family. Plan a certain time each day to do this exercise. Some people prefer to do it first thing in the morning, others at night before they go to bed. Make a list of each part that is activated at that time. For each one, fill in the following answers, if you know them: Name of part What it feels What it looks like Where it is located in your body What it says How it makes you behave Don’t be concerned if you don’t know all this information about the part. Just fill in what you can.

A concerned part is a part that has a negative feeling toward the target part, or any feeling other than those of the Self (curiosity, compassion, and so on). Concerned parts are aware of the ways that the target part is causing trouble in your life. They may be concerned that it alienates you from people, for example, or makes you feel worthless or cuts off your emotions.

I have now presented two classifications of parts—protector and exile, target part and concerned part. Let me clarify. Parts are intrinsically either protectors or exiles, depending on whether they are in pain or protecting against pain. Either one of these can also be a target part. That simply means you have chosen to focus on it. And any protector can also be a concerned part if it has concerns about your target part.

Exercise: Unblending from a Concerned Part Choose a protector that you don’t like or have concerned feelings about. For example, you might judge it or be angry at it or want to get rid of it. You also might feel distant from it or scared of it. These attitudes come from a concerned part of you. First access the protector (P1), and then unblend from it, if necessary (P2). Then practice unblending from the concerned part (P3), as you have learned to do in this chapter. Then go ahead and get to know the protector at least a little (P4). Even though we haven’t covered this step yet, you probably have some idea about how to do this. Ask the part some questions to learn about it and its role in your life. Use the Help Sheet below to guide your steps. Refer to the sheet after each step to help you know what to do next. If you are working with a partner, I recommend that you do this exercise with her. (See Chapter 16 for tips on how to do this.) This recommendation holds for each chapter from now on. Most people find the work easier to do with a partner. In addition, when you commit yourself to a session time with your partner, you are more likely to follow through. The next page contains a Help Sheet which is a summary of the steps for getting to know a protector. It is meant to guide your steps while you are working on yourself or partnering with someone. I recommend you use it in doing the exercises in each chapter from now on.

Help Sheet 1: Getting to Know a Protector P1. Accessing a Part If the part is not activated, imagine yourself in a recent situation when the part was activated. Sense the part in your body or evoke an image of the part. P2. Unblending Target Part Check to see if you are charged up with the part’s emotions or caught up in its beliefs right now. If so, you are blended. Check to see how you feel toward the target part right now. If you can’t tell, you may be blended. If you are blended with the target part, here are some options for unblending. Ask the part to separate from you so you can get to know it. Move back internally to separate from the part. See an image of the part at a distance from you or draw the part. Visualize the part in a room to provide a container for it. Do a short centering/grounding meditation. If the part doesn’t separate, ask what it is afraid would happen if it did. Explain to it the value of separating and reassure it about its fears. P3. Unblending Concerned Part Check to see how you feel toward the target part right now. If you feel compassionate, curious, and so on, you are in Self, so you can move on to P4. If you don’t, then unblend the concerned part: Ask the concerned part if it would be willing to step aside (or relax) just for now so you can get to know the target part from an open place. If it does, check again to see how you feel toward the target part, and repeat. If it isn’t willing to step aside, explain to it the value of stepping aside. If it still won’t, ask what it is afraid would happen if it did, and reassure it about its fears. If it still won’t, make the concerned part the target part and work with it. P4. Discovering a Protector’s Role Invite the part to tell you about itself. The part may answer in words, images, body sensations, emotions, or direct knowing. Here are questions you can ask the part: What do you feel? What are you concerned about? What is your role? What do you do to perform this role? What do you hope to accomplish by playing this role? What are you afraid would happen if you didn’t do this? P5. Developing a Trusting Relationship with a Protector You can foster trust by saying the following to the protector (if true): I understand why you (do your role). I appreciate your efforts on my behalf. I know you’ve been working very hard.

Exercise: Working with a Trailhead in Real Time Choose a trailhead that you are curious about. The exercise is to notice, over the next week, when this trailhead is activated and then access the parts involved. It will help to know what cues will tip you off that it is activated. What kinds of situations or people tend to activate this trailhead? When are these trigger situations likely to occur during the next week? Set an intention to be especially aware, during those times, of whether this part becomes activated. There are also other ways to notice a trailhead. What body sensations, thoughts, or emotions will let you know it is up? What behavior will cue you? Each time you notice the trailhead, access each part briefly and make a list of them. If you can’t stop at the moment to make the list, do it at your next break, or as soon as you can. To help you keep on track with this exercise, take a little time each night before you go to bed to think about whether this trailhead came up that day. If so, did you access the parts involved? If you didn’t, what kept you from doing this? Did you fail to notice that it was activated? Did you notice but not do the exercise? If you did the exercise, what did you learn from it? Take notes and try to answer the above five questions each night. This daily review will also help you to keep the exercise in mind the next day. Don’t expect yourself to catch all the times this trailhead is activated or to access the parts each time. This is very difficult to do. If you are driving or in the midst of a conversation, for example, it’s hard to pull your attention away and tune into the workings of your mind. Just do the best you can.

In reality, most protectors are child parts that developed their protective strategy when you were young and didn’t have the capacity to act in skillful and mature ways. So their actions are simplistic and often extreme like a child’s, and their strategies carry over into adulthood. When a protector is faced with a situation that it perceives as threatening, it will act the only way it knows how, using the tactic it learned in childhood, which is usually dysfunctional in your adult life.

The reason for their restricted vision is that many parts are much more narrow and one dimensional than a whole person is. They have a limited understanding of both the external situation confronting them and your internal system. When triggered, they tend to respond in stereotypical ways, and they’re not particularly sophisticated or intelligent. Not all parts are like this, however. Some can be quite clever and subtle, but most of them are pretty shortsighted.

Exercise: Gaining a Part’s Trust Choose a protector that you have tried to work with that hasn’t been responsive to you. In what ways has it not responded to you? First make sure that you are in Self with respect to this part and not blended with any concerned parts. If you discover any concerned parts, ask them to step aside so you are truly in Self. Concerned parts Check to see if this protector will now talk to you. If it still won’t, work with it as discussed in this chapter and see if you can gain its trust. Answer the following questions about this work: What does the part not trust about you? What happened in the past to make it mistrustful? This may take more than one session.

Exercise: Helping a Protector to Relax in Real Time Think of a situation in which a protector gets triggered that causes you to behave in a problematic way. Do a session in which you get to know the protector that is causing the difficulty. Form a trusting relationship with this protector. Name of protector Describe how it behaves If you were able to act from Self, how would you like to behave? Ask the protector if it will let you lead the next time you are in such a situation. (Make sure you have the life skills to pull off the positive behavior you are aiming for.) If it says no, ask why, and then work with that protector to get to the point where it will agree. Think about when this situation is likely to occur over the next few weeks. Set an intention to be aware of whether this protector takes over at those times. When it does, work with it as described above to help it relax and let you lead. If this works, take notes on what happened as soon as you can. What did your behavior look like when you were leading from Self? What were the results? Continue to track this kind of situation over the next few weeks, doing this exercise each time the part is activated. Each evening before you go to bed, review the day to see if the situation arose, and take notes (or expand your notes) on what happened when you did this exercise. If the protector allowed you to lead and things turned out well, check to see if it now trusts you more. If you didn’t notice the situation at the time or you didn’t do the exercise, explore what got in the way. If this is a situation that doesn’t come up very often, it wouldn’t make sense to do this review every night. You might decide to review once a week. Choose a time frame that is appropriate.

It can be useful to access all parts as they arise, because this gives them a chance to be heard, but in the scenario I outlined above, the parts jumped in on each other so fast that none of them really got much attention. And you couldn’t progress toward healing because you kept getting derailed. IFS provides a way to follow one thread at a time through the tapestry of your psyche until you have unraveled it and healed the part it represents. Plan to stay with the target part you have chosen unless you have a good reason to switch to a different target part. Ask the other parts to step aside.

There is a powerful advantage to understanding that there are two parts involved. Though the protector is keeping you from the pain, it may not realize that there is an exile that is already feeling the pain. It may think it is actually preventing the pain from existing at all rather than preventing you from feeling what the exile is already experiencing.

For example, it is afraid of activating a protector that would fly into a rage or go on a drinking binge. It might not be wrong; this is sometimes a real possibility. There are extreme protectors, and in IFS they are called firefighters. They jump in impulsively to douse the fire of an exile’s pain when it is starting to come up. They have no concern for the possible destructive consequences of their actions. They just want to stop the pain at any cost.

However, sometimes protectors pop up later. While you are working with the exile, if a protector feels threatened by the pain that is coming up from the exile, it may reactivate to block that pain. You may get sleepy or distracted. You may go into your head or get angry.

Exercise: Getting Permission to Work with an Exile Do a session in which you practice getting permission from a protector to work with the exile it guards. If possible, choose a protector that you have already become acquainted with. Re-access the protector, make sure you are in Self, and finish discovering its positive intent and developing a trusting relationship with it, as covered in Chapters 7 and 8. Then recognize who the exile is and work on getting permission to contact it, as covered in this chapter. Once you have permission, invite the exile to tell you or show you what it feels. Take notes on what you discover: Protector Positive intent What it is afraid would happen if it didn’t play its role Exile What the protector is afraid would happen if you contacted the exile What the exile feels

To summarize: In most situations that trigger us, at least two parts are involved. The exile is usually triggered first and then the protector, which pops up to guard it. However, the protector may pop up so quickly that we don’t notice the exile at all. In fact, that is usually the protector’s mission—to prevent us from feeling the pain of the exile.

IFS has discovered a way to explore an exile’s pain safely. You stay in Self and relate to the exile; you don’t become the exile. If you merged with the exile and lost contact with the Self, the pain really could be overwhelming.

Explain to the exile that you will be able to hear his story and help him if you remain in Self. You are not asking the exile to block his feelings; you aren’t suggesting that he shouldn’t feel his emotions. You are simply asking him to keep those feelings separate from you so you can be in a solid place to help. This is one of the most powerful innovations of the IFS method.

Experiencing the exile’s pain in this way means that you are simultaneously in Self and consciously blended with the exile. The exile is showing you her emotion by having you feel it. That is fine as long as you can tolerate this experience and you remain centered and able to be there for the exile, and as long as this doesn’t trigger any protectors.

Empathy is a way of resonating with another person’s feelings (or with an exile’s feelings). Compassion is a feeling of loving kindness toward someone (or an exile) in pain. Empathy often leads to compassion; you resonate with someone’s pain, which stimulates your compassion for him or her. Therefore, the two often occur together. However, it is important to understand how they are different, especially in relating to your exiles.

Help Sheet 2: Getting to Know an Exile 2. Getting Permission to Work With an Exile If necessary, ask the protector to show you the exile. Ask its permission to get to know the exile. If it won’t give permission, ask what it is afraid would happen if you accessed the exile. Possibilities are: The exile has too much pain. Explain that you will stay in Self and get to know the exile, not dive into its pain. There isn’t any point in going into the pain. Explain that there is a point—you can heal the exile. The protector will have no role and therefore be eliminated. Explain that the protector can choose a new role in your psyche. 3. Getting to Know an Exile E1: Accessing an Exile Sense its emotions, feel it in your body, or get an image of it. E2: Unblending From an Exile If you are blended with an exile: Ask the exile to contain its feelings so you can be there for it. Consciously separate from the exile and return to Self. Get an image of the exile at a distance from you. Do a centering/grounding induction. If the exile won’t contain its feelings: Ask it what it is afraid would happen if it did. Explain that you really want to witness its feelings and story, but you need to be separate to do that. Conscious blending: If you can tolerate it, allow yourself to feel the exile’s pain. E3: Unblending Concerned Parts Check how you feel toward the exile. If you aren’t in Self or don’t feel compassion, unblend from any concerned parts. They are usually afraid of your becoming overwhelmed by the exile’s pain. Explain that you will stay in Self and not let the exile overwhelm. E4: Finding Out about an Exile Ask: What do you feel? What makes you feel so scared or hurt (or any other feeling)? E5: Developing a Trusting Relationship with an Exile Let the exile know that you want to hear its story. Communicate to it that you feel compassion and caring toward it. Check to see if the exile can sense you there and notice how if it is taking in your compassion. Exercise: Noticing an Exile in Real Time Choose an exile that you have already gotten to know.

One of the major forces behind our psychological issues is the pain we carry from childhood. The IFS perspective on this is that our exiles carry burdens. A burden is a painful feeling or negative belief about yourself or the world—for example, abandonment, worthlessness, fear of being hit, or shame. An exile ends up carrying a burden into the present because a harmful incident or relationship from the past, usually from childhood, was not metabolized.

Whenever you endure a painful or difficult experience, it must be fully processed and metabolized for your psyche to stay healthy. You must fully feel the experience, make sense of it, and integrate it into your notion of who you are in a way that doesn’t leave you with a negative, inaccurate view of yourself. Even experiences in adult life must be metabolized in this way.

As a child, you often don’t have the resources to metabolize difficult incidents. You can’t do it on your own, so you need a great deal of sensitive support from your parents or other adults. The more painful and traumatic an experience, the more you need support to be able to metabolize it. And this support often isn’t available, either because your parents don’t realize you need it or because they don’t have the capacity to provide it. Or, worst of all, because your parents were the source of the traumatic incident.

When something harmful or traumatic happens to you as a child, an exile takes on the pain, and a protector often takes on the role of stopping the pain. Its goal is to keep the incident from happening again or to stop you from being overwhelmed by the pain. The protector’s role is its burden, in contrast to the exile, whose burden is the pain (or negative belief). It is important to note that not all protectors take on their jobs at the time of a childhood trauma; some do it later in life.

Our parts take on burdens because of painful or traumatic experiences in childhood that we can’t metabolize at the time. We can’t change those experiences; they have already happened. However, we can change their effect on us. It isn’t the experiences themselves that determine how we feel and behave in our adult lives; it is the residue of those experiences in our psyches, which IFS refers to as burdens. Your current issues are caused by the way your psyche was structured by your childhood to hold certain beliefs, body tensions, and emotions. So while you can’t change the past, you can change the way the past is codified in your mind.

The reparenting process actually lays down new neural pathways in the brain. That is why your psyche and your life can change so dramatically. You give that child part a new experience of some aspect of your childhood, an experience that heals or replaces the old one.

So far I have been talking about the original childhood situation as if it involved a parent or parents. However, it can revolve around your brother or sister, or the entire family. It might involve an aunt, uncle, or grandparent. It might even be about the bullies on the playground. That original situation could be an incident in your adult life in which you suffered trauma. (If you’re sent to Iraq, for example, you very well might end up with new burdens.) No matter who was involved or when it happened, the principles remain the same. Act in whatever way the exile needs to rework the situation for the better. Make it come out in a way that lays down a new memory that is healing and freeing for the exile.

Help Sheet 3: Healing an Exile 4. Accessing and Witnessing Childhood Origins Ask the exile to show you an image or a memory of when it learned to feel this way in childhood. Ask the exile how this made it feel. Check to make sure the part has shown you everything it wants to be witnessed. After witnessing, check to see if the exile believes that you understand how bad it was. 5. Reparenting an Exile Bring yourself (as Self) into the childhood situation and ask the exile what it needs from you to heal it or change what happened; then give that to the exile through your internal imagination. Check to see how the exile is responding to the reparenting. If it can’t sense you or isn’t taking in your caring, ask why and work with that. 6: Retrieving an Exile One of the things the exile may need is to be taken out of the childhood situation and brought into a place with it can feel safe and comfortable. You can bring it into some place in your present life, your body, or an imaginary place. 7. Unburdening an Exile Name the burdens (painful feelings or negative beliefs) that the exile is carrying. Ask the exile if it wants to release the burdens and if it is ready to do so. If it doesn’t want to, ask what it is afraid would happen if it let go of them. Then handle those fears. How does the exile carry the burdens in or on its body? What would the exile like to release the burdens to? Light, water, wind, earth, fire, or anything else. Once the burdens are gone, notice what positive qualities or feelings arise in the exile. 8. Releasing the Protective Role Check if the protector is aware of the transformation of the exile. If not, introduce the exile to the protector. See if the protector now realizes that its protective role is no longer necessary. The protector can choose a new role in your psyche.

At the end of the session, ask the exile what she wants from you over the next week or two. Most likely, she will say that she wants you not to forget about her, to stay connected with her. This is very important. Check in with her every day over the next couple of weeks. Make a note to yourself to do this so that you don’t forget. If you do, it could undermine the good work you have just done.

Exercise: Reparenting an Exile in Real Time Choose an exile that you have already given reparenting to. Name of exile Original childhood situation How you reparented the exile You will continue to reparent this exile in real time over the next week. In order to be aware of when the exile is likely to be triggered, answer the following questions: What kinds of situations or people tend to activate this exile? When are these likely to occur during the next week? Set an intention to be aware of whether this part becomes activated during those times. There are also other ways to notice an exile. What body sensations, thoughts, or emotions will let you know she is triggered? When you notice that the exile has been triggered, take a moment to tune into her and find out what she is feeling and what she needs. Most likely, she will need the same form of reparenting that you have already given her in a session. This makes it easy to do because you already know what she needs. Give the exile the reparenting in the moment. Notice how she responds to this.

By the time you reach adulthood, you will have a number of exiles, quite a few protectors, and some parts that haven’t taken on burdens—the healthy parts. They simply manifest their original qualities of joy, playfulness, strength, intelligence, and so on. The goal of IFS is to help all the exiles and protectors—all the burdened parts—release their loads so they can again become who they truly are and manifest their natural positive qualities.

Preparation To help yourself be aware at those times, answer the following questions: What kinds of situations or people tend to activate this protector? When are these likely to occur during the next week? What body sensations, thoughts, behavior, or emotions will let you know it is triggered? During the Week In those situations in which the protector is usually triggered, notice whether or not it becomes activated. If it doesn’t activate, notice how you feel and act that is different than before. Appreciate the changes you have made. Celebrate your success. If the protector does become activated, check in to see what triggered it and what it is afraid of.

This allows us to see that the basis of all inner activity is love. It becomes an even more profound practice when we apply it to other people and their parts. Suppose we understood that everyone’s parts are just doing their best to protect against pain, and this is true even for those people and nations that are causing horrible suffering in the world. This challenges our judgmental and separating attitudes and encourages us to experience our inherent connection with all people and all beings.

For example, though you perform a certain meditation to cultivate loving kindness, you must also transform your judgmental protector so that you can actually relate to people in a loving way. You may feel loving kindness when you are in comfortable, unthreatening circumstances, but if someone dismisses you or attacks you, the judgmental protector will be triggered, interfering with your intention to be kind. To fully liberate loving kindness, you must help the judgmental protector to let go of its role (which usually means first unburdening the exile that is being protected). Once this has happened, you can fully reap the fruits of your meditation practice. Loving kindness can manifest naturally at those moments in your life when it is needed because nothing is in the way.

L’esprit du roman est l’esprit de complexité. Chaque roman dit au lecteur : « Les choses sont plus compliquées que tu ne le penses. » C’est la vérité éternelle du roman mais qui se fait de moins en moins entendre dans le vacarme des réponses simples et rapides qui précèdent la question et l’excluent.

Faussement mondiale. Elle ne concernait que l’Europe, et encore pas toute l’Europe. Mais l’adjectif « mondial » exprime d’autant plus éloquemment la sensation d’horreur devant le fait que, désormais, rien de ce qui se passe sur la planète ne sera plus affaire locale, que toutes les catastrophes concernent le monde entier et que, par conséquent, nous sommes de plus en plus déterminés de l’extérieur, par les situations auxquelles personne ne peut échapper et qui, de plus en plus, nous font ressembler les uns aux autres.

Je pense aussi à ces hécatombes quotidiennes sur les routes, à cette mort qui est aussi affreuse que banale et qui ne ressemble ni au cancer ni au sida car, œuvre non pas de la nature mais de l’homme, elle est une mort quasi volontaire. Comment ne nous frappe-t-elle pas de stupeur, ne bouleverse-t-elle pas notre vie, ne nous incite-t-elle pas à d’énormes réformes ? Non, elle ne nous frappe pas de stupeur car, comme Pasenow, nous avons un pauvre sens du réel, et cette mort, dissimulée sous le masque d’une belle voiture, représente, en fait, dans la sphère surréelle des symboles, la vie ; souriante, elle se confond avec la modernité, la liberté, l’aventure,

composer un roman c’est juxtaposer différents espaces émotionnels, et que c’est là, selon moi, l’art le plus subtil d’un romancier. C. S. : Votre éducation musicale a-t-elle beaucoup influencé votre écriture ? M. K. : Jusqu’à vingt-cinq ans, j’étais beaucoup plus attiré par la musique que par la littérature. La meilleure chose que j’ai faite alors fut une composition pour quatre instruments : piano, alto, clarinette et batterie. Elle préfigurait presque caricaturalement l’architecture de mes romans dont, à l’époque, je ne soupçonnais même pas l’existence future. Cette Composition pour quatre instruments est divisée, figurez-vous, en sept parties ! Comme c’est le cas dans mes romans, l’ensemble est composé de parties formellement très hétérogènes (jazz ; parodie d’une valse ; fugue ; choral ; etc.) et dont chacune a une orchestration différente (piano, alto ; piano solo ; alto, clarinette, batterie ; etc.). Cette diversité formelle est équilibrée par une très grande unité thématique : du commencement jusqu’à la fin sont élaborés seulement deux thèmes : A et B. Les trois dernières parties sont basées sur une polyphonie que j’ai considérée à l’époque comme très originale : l’évolution simultanée de deux thèmes différents et émotionnellement contradictoires ; par exemple, dans la dernière partie : on répète sur un magnétophone l’enregistrement du troisième mouvement (le thème A conçu comme un choral solennel pour clarinette, alto, piano) tandis que, en même temps, la batterie et la trompette (le clarinettiste devait échanger sa clarinette contre une trompette) interviennent avec une variation (dans le style « barbaro ») du thème B. Et encore une curieuse ressemblance : c’est dans la sixième partie qu’apparaît pour une seule fois un nouveau thème, C, tout à fait comme Kostka de La Plaisanterie ou le quadragénaire de La vie est ailleurs. Je vous raconte tout cela pour vous montrer que la forme d’un roman, sa « structure mathématique », n’est pas quelque chose de calculé ; c’est un impératif inconscient, une obsession. Autrefois, j’ai même pensé que cette forme qui m’obsède était une sorte de définition algébrique de ma propre personne mais, un jour, il y a quelques années, en me penchant plus attentivement sur le quatuor op. 131 de Beethoven, j’ai dû abandonner cette conception narcissique et subjective de la forme. Regardez : Premier mouvement : lent ; forme de fugue ; 7,21 minutes. Deuxième mouvement : rapide ; forme inclassable ; 3,26 mn. Troisième mouvement :

Worry is a name for mental effort: ideally one wants to worry more insightfully and more purposefully. The aim of adult life, one might say, is to worry well. We worry about things that matter; worry implies care. So: how much should you care about money? In what ways should you care about money? And for what reasons should you care about money? Should you feel fearful of money? Self-knowledge, skill and courage – the true antidotes to fear – do not make danger go away. They enable us to live a more flourishing life, despite the existence of danger.

Our relationship with money becomes unhealthy when we remove it from this cycle. That happens when we stop seeing money as potential possessions and experiences – but rather see possessions and experiences as potential money. That’s the situation of the person who does not see a painting, but only a price; who does not see an education, but only earning potential. And it happens when we see our activities just as ways of making money and not as activities to be evaluated for their inherent worth.

Instead of dismissing this kind of experience as just fantasy, or endlessly repeating it, one should examine it, learn from it. Not rejecting it means, to start with, accepting a bit of pain. I’ve imagined something genuinely good and I can’t have it. I’m not going to tell myself that it isn’t good, simply because I can’t have it. This sentiment of rejection emerges – a bit crudely

It is important to understand that ‘need/want’ does not map onto ‘basic/refined’ or ‘cheap/luxurious’. And for powerful reasons. ‘Need/want’ is a psychological distinction relative to individual flourishing and the pursuit of one’s best self. ‘Basic/refined’ is a distinction about the level of complexity of an object. ‘Cheap/expensive’ is a distinction to do with price and demand.

They judge objects, ideas and people on their intrinsic merits (rather than on the reflection of their status – what others think). 3. They have good taste: they can home in on what they really like and why they like it, and therefore identify it in less obvious places and cases. 4. They are creative: they look at potential and are not worried about taking responsibility for realizing potential.

Money can be made in really good ways. So we should always be asking how people made their money – not just how much they happen to have. When wealth is made by really serving the best interests of humanity, then the people who make money this way are our friends – in imagination, I mean. So you don’t have to be anti-money to be critical of many of the sources of wealth.

To be sure, just being poor is no guarantee that any of these benefits will accrue: they don’t attach themselves automatically where there is an absence of cash. Rather they depend upon a voluntary condition: a willingness to not have the things that most people do want. They come from not being afraid of lack of money.

Money troubles are really just about money – not about the relationship. If I have a heap of debts and bills and no money I’m in real trouble; and it doesn’t matter how interesting or mature my view of life is, or how imaginative I am, or how beautiful my taste. None of those fine qualities will help. I’ve either got to find more cash, or restructure, or go under. Our money worries are almost all about the relationship. They are largely about what is going on in our minds. And the solution – the way to worry less about money – turns out to be about improving what we as individuals bring to the relationship. We need to look at our own contribution. We need to become more imaginative, more patient, more attentive to the lessons of our own experience, more serious about the things we most care for, more canny, more independent in our judgements.

Épicure, le premier grand théoricien du plaisir, a compris la vie bienheureuse d'une façon extrêmement sceptique : éprouve du plaisir celui qui ne souffre pas. C'est donc la souffrance qui est la notion fondamentale de l'hédonisme : on est heureux dans la mesure où on sait écarter la souffrance ; et comme les plaisirs apportent souvent plus de malheur que de bonheur, Épicure ne recommande que des plaisirs prudents et modestes.

La façon dont on raconte l'Histoire contemporaine ressemble à un grand concert où l'on présenterait d'affilée les cent trente-huit opus de Beethoven mais en jouant seulement les huit premières mesures de chacun d'eux. Si on refaisait le même concert dans dix ans, on ne jouerait, de chaque pièce, que la seule première note, donc cent trente-huit notes pendant tout le concert, présentées comme une seule mélodie. Et dans vingt ans, toute la musique de Beethoven se résumerait en une seule très longue note aiguë qui ressemblerait à celle, infinie et très haute, qu'il a entendue le premier jour de sa surdité.

Je sais aussi, dit Candide, qu'il faut cultiver notre jardin.—Vous avez raison, dit Pangloss, car quand l'homme fut mis dans le jardin d'Éden, il y fut mis ut operaretur eum, pour qu'il travaillât, ce qui prouve que l'homme n'est pas né pour le repos.—Travaillons sans raisonner, dit Martin: c'est le seul moyen de rendre la vie supportable.»

Un homme, au moins, est libre ; il peut parcourir les passions et les pays, traverser les obstacles, mordre aux bonheurs les plus lointains. Mais une femme est empêchée continuellement. Inerte et flexible à la fois, elle a contre elle les mollesses de la chair avec les dépendances de la loi. Sa volonté, comme le voile de son chapeau retenu par un cordon, palpite à tous les vents ; il y a toujours quelque désir qui entraîne, quelque convenance qui retient.

Le lendemain fut, pour Emma, une journée funèbre. Tout lui parut enveloppé par une atmosphère noire qui flottait confusément sur l’extérieur des choses, et le chagrin s’engouffrait dans son âme avec des hurlements doux, comme fait le vent d’hiver dans les châteaux abandonnés. C’était cette rêverie que l’on a sur ce qui ne reviendra plus, la lassitude qui vous prend après chaque fait accompli, cette douleur enfin que vous apportent l’interruption de tout mouvement accoutumé, la cessation brusque d’une vibration prolongée.

Parce que des lèvres libertines ou vénales lui avaient murmuré des phrases pareilles, il ne croyait que faiblement à la candeur de celles-là ; on en devait rabattre, pensait-il, les discours exagérés cachant les affections médiocres ; comme si la plénitude de l’âme ne débordait pas quelquefois par les métaphores les plus vides, puisque personne, jamais, ne peut donner l’exacte mesure de ses besoins, ni de ses conceptions, ni de ses douleurs, et que la parole humaine est comme un chaudron fêlé où nous battons des mélodies à faire danser les ours, quand on voudrait attendrir les étoiles.

Hiding is an act of freedom from the misunderstanding of others, especially in the enclosing world of oppressive secret government and private entities, attempting to name us, to anticipate us, to leave us with no place to hide and grow in ways unmanaged by a creeping necessity for absolute naming, absolute tracking and absolute control. Hiding is a bid for independence, from others, from mistaken ideas we have about ourselves, from an oppressive and mistaken wish to keep us completely safe, completely ministered to, and therefore completely managed. Hiding is creative, necessary and beautifully subversive of outside interference and control. Hiding leaves life to itself, to become more of itself. Hiding is the radical independence necessary for our emergence into the light of a proper human future.

But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the self nor of the other; the ultimate touchstone is witness: the privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.

Si, jadis, l’Histoire avançait beaucoup plus lentement que la vie humaine, aujourd’hui c’est elle qui va plus vite, qui court, qui échappe à l’homme, si bien que la continuité et l’identité d’une vie risquent de se briser. Ainsi le romancier ressent-il le besoin de garder à côté de notre façon de vivre le souvenir de celle, timide, à demi oubliée, de nos prédécesseurs.

J’imagine que Beethoven écrivait ses sonates en rêvant d’être l’héritier de toute la musique européenne depuis ses débuts. Ce rêve que je lui attribue, le rêve de la grande synthèse (synthèse de deux époques apparemment irréconciliables), n’a trouvé son plein accomplissement que cent ans plus tard, chez les plus grands compositeurs du modernisme, notamment chez Schönberg et chez Stravinsky qui étaient eux aussi, malgré leurs chemins totalement opposés (ou qu’Adorno a voulu voir comme totalement opposés*), non pas (seulement) les continuateurs de leurs précurseurs immédiats mais, et ce tout à fait consciemment, des héritiers intégraux (et probablement les derniers) de toute l’histoire de la musique.

Il suffît qu’un violoniste joue les trois premières longues notes d’un largo pour qu’un auditeur sensible soupire : « Ah, que c’est beau ! » Dans ces trois premières notes qui ont provoqué l’émotion, il n’y a rien, aucune invention, aucune création, rien du tout : la plus ridicule « duperie sentimentale ». Mais personne n’est à l’abri de cette perception de la musique, de ce soupir niais qu’elle suscite. La musique européenne est fondée sur le son artificiel d’une note et d’une gamme ; ainsi se trouve-t-elle à l’opposé de la sonorité objective du monde. Depuis sa naissance, elle est liée, par une convention insurmontable, au besoin d’exprimer une subjectivité. Elle s’oppose à la sonorité brute du monde extérieur comme l’âme sensible s’oppose à l’insensibilité de l’univers. Mais le moment peut venir (dans la vie d’un homme ou dans celle d’une civilisation) où la sentimentalité (considérée jusqu’alors comme une force qui rend l’homme plus humain et pallie la froideur de sa raison) est dévoilée d’emblée comme la « superstructure de la brutalité », toujours présente dans la haine, dans la vengeance, dans l’enthousiasme des victoires sanglantes. C’est alors que la musique m’est apparue comme le bruit assourdissant des émotions, tandis que le monde de bruits dans les compositions de Xenakis est devenu beauté ; la beauté lavée de la saleté affective, dépourvue de la barbarie sentimentale. 4 J’ajoute en 2008 : Par pure coïncidence, dans ces jours où je pense à Xenakis, je lis le livre d’un jeune écrivain autrichien, Thomas Glavanic : Le Travail de la nuit. L’homme de trente ans, Jonas, se réveille un matin et le monde qu’il retrouve est vide, sans humains ; son appartement, les rues, les magasins, les cafés, tout est là, inchangé, comme avant, avec toutes les traces de ceux

The fundamental postulate of the theory of relativity, as it was called, was that the laws of science should be the same for all freely moving observers, no matter what their speed. This was true for Newton’s laws of motion, but now the idea was extended to include Maxwell’s theory and the speed of light: all observers should measure the same speed of light, no matter how fast they are moving.

As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass rises ever more quickly, so it takes more and more energy to speed it up further. It can in fact never reach the speed of light, because by then its mass would have become infinite, and by the equivalence of mass and energy, it would have taken an infinite amount of energy to get it there. For this reason, any normal object is forever confined by relativity to move at speeds slower than the speed of light. Only light, or other waves that have no intrinsic mass, can move at the speed of light.

Force-carrying particles can be grouped into four categories according to the strength of the force that they carry and the particles with which they interact. It should be emphasized that this division into four classes is man-made; it is convenient for the construction of partial theories, but it may not correspond to anything deeper. Ultimately, most physicists hope to find a unified theory that will explain all four forces as different aspects of a single force.

How is it possible that a black hole appears to emit particles when we know that nothing can escape from within its event horizon?

A flow of negative energy into the black hole therefore reduces its mass. As the black hole loses mass, the area of its event horizon gets smaller, but this decrease in the entropy of the black hole is more than compensated for by the entropy of the emitted radiation, so the second law is never violated.

However, there are at least three arrows of time that do distinguish the past from the future. They are the thermodynamic arrow, the direction of time in which disorder increases; the psychological arrow, the direction of time in which we remember the past and not the future; and the cosmological arrow, the direction of time in which the universe expands rather than contracts.

It’s ok to over-capture, as you can always throw away spurious captured stuff later; on the other hand, you can’t un-forget something you forgot to note down, and these non-noted-down things can pile up on your mind, even when you can’t exactly or consciously remember them

As Theo Compernolle, author of “Brainchains", put it: “If you take some time to reflect, you have a five times higher chance that you will do the right things, the most important things, the most ethical things, rewarding things, the most enjoyable things, the most fun things. If you do not take time to reflect, all that stuff that is not really important, rewarding or fun crowds out the best and leaves you unsatisfied and trying to compensate by doing even more.”

Anything else, for instance a series of next actions that grouped together take more than 5mins of focus, are mini-projects which reside on the same lists as other reminders (so on next actions, waiting, someday/maybe etc).

What I mean by a review in the AoL practice is not merely looking at the list of projects (or higher commitments [←#horizonsOfCommitment]), but actually stopping at and analyzing each commitment. This translates into doing some or all of the following, on a case by case basis [#whatIsAnAoLReview]: ​​going through all items tagged as related to it, ​​checking out waiting and next actions you have, ​​assessing if (and why) something is stuck and handling blockages, ​​making or reading/revising plans, ​​thinking about options and new potential directions (on someday/maybe list), ​​revisiting previous thinking on certain issues/ideas on someday/maybe list, ​​making connections between different ideas within the project, and with related stuff outside of the project, ​​getting creative by making new associations between existing ideas, ​​recognizing and defusing ticking time bombs that would otherwise explode in your face later.

David Allen prescribes reviewing all what’s on the lists in your system every week. This is namely valid for both the waiting list and especially the someday/maybe list (which can be pretty long). To remind you, this is a system supposed to contain all your thinking, ideas, worries and work on everything. If you haven't guessed it already, reviewing the whole system every week is too much — it’s simply overkill to do this!

The actual, optimal solution is recognizing that next actions generated by GTD and similar algorithms can be both actionable and optional; in my opinion it’s cumbersome and too rigid to create completely distinct lists for every category these things fall under, the optional type of items on the next action list should instead be identifiable and filterable on the next action list itself

The same approach can be used to have someday/maybe items (especially decisions) appear on your radar on a specific day; this way you can let yourself sleep on something and trigger yourself to (start to) think about it at a specific date. This is a perfect tool for slow decision making, as you can set the start date to have a decision show up at an arbitrarily chosen date (depending on the case), which is a non-intrusive way (since there is no extra deadline) to remind yourself about a decision you want to take at a certain point in time (maybe a couple of days or weeks before it’s due, if it’s due at all).

sirtuins are enzymes that remove acetyl tags from histones and other proteins and, by doing so, change the packaging of the DNA, turning genes off and on when needed. These critical epigenetic regulators sit at the very top of cellular control systems, controlling our reproduction and our DNA repair.

Sirtuins aren’t the only longevity genes. Two other very well studied sets of genes perform similar roles, which also have been proven to be manipulable in ways that can offer longer and healthier lives. One of these is called target of rapamycin, or TOR, a complex of proteins that regulates growth and metabolism.

There are some simple tests to determine how biologically old you probably are. The number of push-ups you can do is a good indicator. If you are over 45 and can do more than twenty, you are doing well. The other test of age is the sitting-rising test (SRT). Sit on the floor, barefooted, with legs crossed. Lean forward quickly and see if you can get up in one move. A young person can. A middle-aged person typically needs to push off with one of their hands. An elderly person often needs to get onto one knee. A study of people 51 to 80 years found that 157 out of 159 people who passed away in 75 months had received less than perfect SRT scores.

When we stay healthy and vibrant, as long as we feel young physically and mentally, our age doesn’t matter. That’s true whether you are 32, 52, or 92. Most middle-aged and older adults in the United States report feeling ten to twenty years younger than their age, because they still feel healthy. And feeling younger than your age predicts lower mortality and better cognitive abilities later in life.22 It’s a virtuous cycle, as long as you keep pedaling.

Leucine, for instance, is well known to boost muscle, which is why it’s found in large quantities in the protein drinks that bodybuilders often chug before, during, and after workouts. But that muscle building is coming in part because leucine is activating mTOR, which essentially calls out to your body, “Times are good right now, let’s disengage the survival circuit.”28 In the long run, however, protein drinks may be preventing the mTOR pathway from providing its longevity benefits.

Limiting food intake and reducing the heavy load of amino acids in most diets aren’t the only ways to activate longevity genes that order our cells to shift into survival mode. Exercise, by definition, is the application of stress to our bodies. It raises NAD levels, which in turn activates the survival network, which turns up energy production and forces muscles to grow extra oxygen-carrying capillaries. The longevity regulators AMPK, mTOR, and sirtuins are all modulated in the right direction by exercise, irrespective of caloric intake, building new blood vessels, improving heart and lung health, making people stronger, and, yes, extending telomeres.

Tout homme devrait recevoir du poison le jour de sa majorité. Une cérémonie solennelle devrait avoir lieu à cette occasion. Non pour l’inciter au suicide, mais, au contraire, pour qu’il vive avec plus d’assurance et plus de sérénité. Pour qu’il vive en sachant qu’il est le maître de sa vie et de sa mort.

People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments. Which is why, even when we’ve experienced the same events as other individuals, we never constructed identical narratives: the criteria used for selecting moments were different for each of us, and a reflection of our personalities. Each of us noticed the details that caught our attention and remembered what was important to us, and the narratives we built shaped our personalities in turn.

It is critical, on the morning of an MDMA session, to eat a light, simple breakfast—porridge, for example. It is also advisable to make at least three fresh-fruit smoothies (approx. 300ml each); a light snack (for half-way through the session); and dinner (for afterwards). Consuming these three smoothies at intervals during your MDMA Solo session will minimize the chance of a ‘comedown’ after the efects of the MDMA have worn of. The smoothies can be drunk at approximately two-hour intervals as the session progresses. Dinner can include a fruit salad as dessert. You can also supplement after the session with a standard multivitamin pill

La tendresse prend naissance à l’instant où nous sommes rejetés sur le seuil de l’âge adulte et où nous nous rendons compte avec angoisse des avantages de l’enfance que nous ne comprenions pas quand nous étions enfants. La tendresse, c’est la frayeur que nous inspire l’âge adulte. La tendresse, c’est la tentative de créer un espace artificiel où l’autre doit être traité comme un enfant. La tendresse, c’est aussi la frayeur des conséquences physiques de l’amour ; c’est une tentative de soustraire l’amour au monde des adultes (où il est insidieux, contraignant, lourd de chair et de responsabilité) et de considérer la femme comme un enfant.

Lire Kundera, c’est donc adopter ce point de vue de Satan, sur la politique et l’histoire, sur la poésie, sur l’amour et, de façon générale, sur toute connaissance.

It is always hard to believe that the courageous step is so close to us, that it is closer than we ever could imagine, that in fact we already know what it is, and that the step is simpler, more radical than we had thought: just picking up the pen or the wood chisel, just picking up the instrument or the phone, which is why we so often prefer the story to be more elaborate, our identities to be safely clouded by fear, why we want the horizon to remain always in the distance, the promise never fully and simply made, the essay longer than it needs to be and the answer safely in the realm of impossibility.

Despair turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season and start to shape our identity around its frozen disappointments. But despair can only stay beyond its appointed time through the forced artificiality of created distance, by abstracting ourselves from bodily feeling, by trapping ourselves in the disappointed mind, by convincing ourselves that the seasons have stopped and can never turn again, and perhaps, most simply and importantly, by refusing to let the body breathe by itself, fully and deeply.

The antidote to despair is not to be found in the brave attempt to cheer ourselves up with happy abstracts, but in paying a profound and courageous attention to the body and the breath, independent of our imprisoning thoughts and stories, even, surprisingly, in paying attention to despair itself, and the way we hold on to it, and which we realise was never ours to own and to hold in the first place. To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.

Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it. Two very different interpretations. The physical universe was a language with a perfectly ambiguous grammar.

Until now, in our own lives, we perhaps thought of love in terms of what another person could give us. Now, having had children, our vision of love is massively reoriented.

Failing one’s children gives them an incentive to go on and achieve things on their own. What a terrifying spectre it would be if we truly were perfect. It would make their own lives directionless and punishing. They should thank us for letting them down; our flaws give them a role and a mission.

Experiencing real pain ourselves, our moral superiority comes to an end; we stop urging others to get with the programme, to get their act together or to sharpen up, and start to look for the particular form of debilitation, visible or invisible, that every person struggles to overcome. In pain, we suddenly find our understanding and compassion engaged as to why others may find it hard to fully participate.

Making a desired state into a trait, an enduring quality of our being, requires two basic steps. The first is to “have the experience,” either by recognizing it when it arises spontaneously or by purposely eliciting it with a resource anchor. The second is to offer our full, sustained, and immersed attention to that positive state and to the self-sense that arises with it. Psy-chologist Rick Hanson calls this second step “installation.” It gives the positive experience “stickiness,” so that it becomes installed in our long-term implicit memory for future retrieval.

Often there’s a nagging sense of “something’s missing.” But what happens if instead of pursuing what we think we want, we stay there? What happens if we encourage ourselves (as with a kind hand on our shoulder) to trust that “this is it”? Gradually we will discover the fullness and aliveness of our own presence. With this comes the blessing of feeling “enough”—that what we really long for is already here.

To want to run away is an essence of being human; it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice. To think about fleeing from circumstances, from a marriage, a relationship or from a work is part of the conversation itself and helps us understand the true distilled nature of our own reluctance, thus allowing us a deeper honesty about the cross-currents of our difficulty in being fully present.

See through those compassionate eyes, and tell your small self, “It’s not your fault.” Or try saying, “You’re okay, sweetheart,” or “These cravings are yours, but they are not all of you.” And remind yourself, “Others feel this too.” If you bring a compassionate presence to shame over and over again, it will gradually loosen its grip.

REMEMBRANCE: PAUSE FOR PRESENCE For now, set your intention to pause in just one or two situations of moderate stress and reactivity. It might be when you see a flurry of new emails needing a response; when you’re worrying about an upcoming deadline; about to enter a demanding meeting; or feeling irritated with a friend, colleague, or family member. The pause itself is simple. Stop whatever you’re doing, become still, and take a moment to Recognize and Allow whatever emotions and thoughts are present. Then take three to five long, deep breaths. With each, match the length of the inhale and exhale: Breathe in fully, filling your chest and lungs, and then release with a long, slow out breath. When you’ve finished, notice if anything has changed, and then continue with your day. Gradually expand the number of situations in which you practice an intentional pause, including those that involve more emotional triggering. In time, you’ll be able to pause in a wide range of situations, and you’ll have more access to your inner clarity, resilience, and heart.

REMEMBRANCE: SAY YES TO WHAT’S HERE While we need to open to our deep fears and losses, we can develop our resilience and confidence if we first practice saying yes to moderate discomfort and unpleasantness. You might try saying yes when you have indigestion or a headache; when you are anxious about being late, annoyed that the car was left close to “empty,” or disappointed at missing a dear one’s wedding. Keep in mind that your “yes” is directed toward your own inner experience, not toward what someone else is doing. You are meeting your edge—any sense of emotional reactivity or inner conflict—and softening.

REMEMBRANCE: REST IN AWARENESS Set your intention to rest in awareness at times when you are calm and quietly present. It might be when you lie down to sleep and can feel yourself unwinding; when you are listening to the sound of wind or rain; when you are looking at cloud formations or the intricacy of a flower; when you are with someone in comfortable silence. It might also be when you’ve arrived at your destination, right before getting out of the car. Or when you are standing and looking out a window. Close your eyes, be still, and notice the foreground of what you are experiencing—the thoughts, sensations, images, sounds.

It might also be when you’ve arrived at your destination, right before getting out of the car. Or when you are standing and looking out a window. Close your eyes, be still, and notice the foreground of what you are experiencing—the thoughts, sensations, images, sounds. Let everything be just as it is. Then notice your own presence, the formless awareness in the background. What is awareness? Can you sense the silence? The stillness? The openness that everything is happening in? Relax and rest in this awareness; become the awareness. Often after just a few seconds, the mind re-fixates on something in the foreground—or perhaps on a thought about what’s next. This is natural. Rather than struggle to sustain awareness of awareness (which is another “doing”), simply be mindful as you continue with your day. The most helpful way to practice resting in awareness is for brief moments, many times a day. If you approach this remembrance with curiosity and ease, you will find that you become increasingly drawn toward, and then at home in, the inner stillness of being.

Malgré l’absence de tout danger, elle ne pouvait se défaire d’une certaine angoisse à l’idée qu’une seconde de sa vie, au lieu de se convertir en néant comme toutes les autres secondes, sera arrachée au cours du temps et, si un hasard imbécile vient à l’exiger un jour, ressuscitera comme un mort mal enterré.

Cette image éveille en moi une question : à l’époque des caméras, l’immortalité a-t-elle changé de caractère ? Je n’hésite pas à répondre : au fond, non ; car l’objectif photographique, avant d’être inventé, était déjà là en tant que sa propre essence immatérialisée. Sans qu’aucun objectif réel n’ait été braqué sur eux, les gens se comportaient déjà comme s’ils étaient photographiés.

Cette fois, la mesure était à son comble : la préposition ohne (sans) régit l’accusatif, la préposition mit (avec) régit le datif. Pourquoi ? Les deux prépositions signifient en fait les aspects négatif et positif du même rapport, de sorte qu’elles devraient entraîner la même déclinaison. Brigitte l’avait fait remarquer à son professeur, un jeune Allemand que l’objection avait embarrassé et qui s’était aussitôt senti coupable. Cet homme sympathique et subtil souffrait d’appartenir à un peuple qui avait été gouverné par Hitler. Prêt à charger sa patrie de toutes les tares, il admit immédiatement qu’aucune raison valable ne justifiait deux déclinaisons différentes avec les prépositions mit et ohne.

Si donc, sur notre tableau allégorique, Beethoven croise un groupe d’aristocrates sans ôter son chapeau, cela ne peut pas signifier que les aristocrates soient de méprisables réactionnaires et lui, un révolutionnaire admirable ; cela signifie que ceux qui créent (des statues, des poèmes, des symphonies) méritent plus de respect que ceux qui gouvernent (des domestiques, des fonctionnaires ou des peuples). Que la création représente plus que le pouvoir, l’art plus que la politique. Que les œuvres sont immortelles, non les guerres ni les bals des princes.

Ce qui incite les gens à lever le poing, à saisir un fusil, à défendre ensemble de justes ou d’injustes causes, ce n’est pas la raison, mais l’âme hypertrophiée. C’est elle, le carburant sans lequel le moteur de l’Histoire n’aurait pu tourner et faute de quoi l’Europe serait restée couchée sur la pelouse, à regarder paresseusement les nuages qui flottent au ciel. Christiane ne souffrait d’aucune hypertrophie de l’âme et ne désirait nullement s’exhiber sur la grande scène de l’Histoire. Je la soupçonne d’avoir préféré s’allonger sur la pelouse, pour regarder les nuages flotter dans le ciel. (Je la soupçonne même d’avoir, en de tels moments, été heureuse ; idée déplaisante pour l’homme à l’âme hypertrophiée qui, consumé par les flammes de son moi, n’est jamais heureux.)

Avant même de disparaître du paysage, les chemins ont disparu de l’âme humaine : l’homme n’a plus le désir de cheminer et d’en tirer une jouissance. Sa vie non plus, il ne la voit pas comme un chemin, mais comme une route : comme une ligne menant d’un point à un autre, du grade de capitaine au grade de général, du statut d’épouse au statut de veuve. Le temps de vivre s’est réduit à un simple obstacle qu’il faut surmonter à une vitesse toujours croissante.

What’s needed instead in such situations, I gradually came to understand, is a kind of anti-skill: not the counterproductive strategy of trying to make yourself more efficient, but rather a willingness to resist such urges – to learn to stay with the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed, of not being on top of everything, without automatically responding by trying to fit more in. To approach your days in this fashion means, instead of clearing the decks, declining to clear the decks, focusing instead on what’s truly of greatest consequence while tolerating the discomfort of knowing that, as you do so, the decks will be filling up further, with emails and errands and other to-dos, many of which you may never get round to at all. You’ll sometimes still decide to drive yourself hard in an effort to squeeze more in, when circumstances absolutely require it. But that won’t be your default mode, because you’ll no longer be operating under the illusion of one day making time for everything. The same goes for existential overwhelm: what’s required is the will to resist the urge to consume more and more experiences, since that strategy can only lead to the feeling of having even more experiences left to consume. Once you truly understand that you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many you still haven’t experienced stops feeling like a problem. Instead, you get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for – and the freer you are to choose, in each moment, what counts the most.

The second principle is to limit your work in progress. Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts – because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead.

The person mired in this mentality believes that the reason she doesn’t feel fulfilled and happy is that she hasn’t yet managed to accomplish certain specific things; when she does so, she imagines, she’ll feel in charge of her life and be the master of her time. Yet in fact the way she’s attempting to achieve that sense of security means she’ll never feel fulfilled, because she’s treating the present solely as a path to some superior future state – and so the present moment won’t ever feel satisfying in itself. Even if she does get her workload under control, or meet her soulmate, she’ll just find some other reason to postpone her fulfilment until later on.

there will be a last time that you visit your childhood home, or swim in the sea, or make love, or have a deep conversation with a certain close friend. Yet usually there’ll be no way to know, in the moment itself, that you’re doing it for the last time. Harris’s point is that we should therefore try to treat every such experience with the reverence we’d show if it were the final instance of it.

The problem is that the effort to be present in the moment, though it seems like the exact opposite of the instrumentalist, future-focused mindset I’ve been criticising in this chapter, is in fact just a slightly different version of it. You’re so fixated on trying to make the best use of your time – in this case not for some later outcome, but for an enriching experience of life right now – that it obscures the experience itself. It’s like trying too hard to fall asleep, and therefore failing.

this is just a country walk, perhaps the most mundane of leisure activities – and yet, as a way of spending one’s time, it does have one or two features worth noting. For one thing, unlike almost everything else I do with my life, it’s not relevant to ask whether I’m any good at it: all I’m doing is walking, a skill at which I haven’t appreciably improved since around the age of four. Moreover, a country walk doesn’t have a purpose, in the sense of an outcome you’re trying to achieve or somewhere you’re trying to get.

The peace of mind on offer here is of a higher order: it lies in the recognition that being unable to escape from the problems of finitude is not, in itself, a problem. The human disease is often painful, but as the Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck puts it, it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure.3 Accept the inevitability of the affliction, and freedom ensues: you can get on with living at last.

it is from this position of not feeling as though you need to earn your weeks on the planet that you can do the most genuine good with them.

The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. But that isn’t a reason for unremitting despair, or for living in an anxiety-fuelled panic about making the most of your limited time. It’s a cause for relief. You get to give up on something that was always impossible – the quest to become the optimised, infinitely capable, emotionally invincible, fully independent person you’re officially supposed to be. Then you get to roll up your sleeves and start work on what’s gloriously possible instead.

even in these essential domains, there’s scope to fail on a cyclical basis: to aim to do the bare minimum at work for the next two months, for example, while you focus on your children, or let your fitness goals temporarily lapse while you apply yourself to election canvassing. Then switch your energies to whatever you were neglecting. To live this way is to replace the high-pressure quest for ‘work–life balance’ with a conscious form of imbalance, backed by your confidence that the roles in which you’re underperforming right now will get their moment in the spotlight soon.

Shinzen Young teaches ‘Do Nothing’ meditation, for which the instructions are to simply set a timer, probably only for five or ten minutes at first; sit down in a chair; and then stop trying to do anything. Every time you notice you’re doing something – including thinking, or focusing on your breathing, or anything else – stop doing it. (If you notice you’re criticising yourself inwardly for doing things, well, that’s a thought, too, so stop doing that.) Keep on stopping until the timer goes off.

Girard discovered that most of what we desire is mimetic (mi-met-ik) or imitative, not intrinsic. Humans learn—through imitation—to want the same things other people want, just as they learn how to speak the same language and play by the same cultural rules. Imitation plays a far more pervasive role in our society than anyone had ever openly acknowledged.

An unbelieved truth is often more dangerous than a lie. The lie in this case is the idea that I want things entirely on my own, uninfluenced by others, that I’m the sovereign king of deciding what is wantable and what is not. The truth is that my desires are derivative, mediated by others, and that I’m part of an ecology of desire that is bigger than I can fully understand.

So my hope is that even if you don’t think of yourself as spiritual, these approaches will be helpful because they are grounded in a fundamental truth about what it means to be human: we are not entirely our own, but exist in a web of relationships connected by desire.

Core motivational drives are enduring, irresistible, and insatiable. They are probably explanatory of much of your behavior since the time you were a child. Think of them as your motivational energy—the reason you consistently gravitate toward certain types of projects (team versus individual, goal-oriented versus ideation) and activities (sports, arts, theater, forms of fitness) and not others.

(1) pay attention to the interior movements of the heart when contemplating different desires—which give a fleeting feeling of satisfaction and which give satisfaction that endures? (2) ask yourself which desire is more generous and loving; (3) put yourself on your deathbed in your mind’s eye and ask yourself which desire you would be more at peace with having followed; (4) finally, and most importantly, ask yourself where a given desire comes from.

Solitary confinement is a good and necessary thing for a human being. I’m not referring to forced solitary confinement. Our criminal justice system uses it atrociously.

Set aside at least three consecutive days every year for a personal silent retreat. No talking, no screens, no music. Only books. Deep silence is the kind of silence you enter into when the echoes and comforts of normal noise have completely receded and you are alone with yourself. A five-day retreat is ideal because often the noise of the world doesn’t fully recede from our minds until the end of the third day (and the major benefits of the silence flow once that has happened)—but three days is a good place to start.

There is no goal in this exercise other than learning how not to have a goal. As you look at the tree, pay attention to everything you notice.

Il imagine un sort qui s’acharne à dessein sur lui pour le tourmenter, et trouvant un aliment à sa colère, il s’anime et s’enflamme contre l’ennemi qu’il s’est créé.

When we stop valuing something, it ceases to be fun or interesting to us. Therefore, there is no sense of loss, no sense of missing out when we stop doing it. On the contrary, we look back and wonder how we ever spent so much time caring about such a silly, trivial thing, why we wasted so much energy on issues and causes that didn’t matter. These pangs of regret or embarrassment are good; they signify growth. They are the product of our achieving our hopes.

Like a surgeon’s scalpel, hope can save a life, and hope can take a life. It can uplift us, and it can destroy us. Just as there are healthy and damaging forms of confidence, and healthy and damaging forms of love, there are also healthy and damaging forms of hope. And the difference between the two is not always clear.

fati, for Nietzsche, meant the unconditional acceptance of all life and experience: the highs and the lows, the meaning and the meaninglessness. It meant loving one’s pain, embracing one’s suffering. It meant closing the separation between one’s desires and reality not by striving for more desires, but by simply desiring reality.

Unfortunately, as they grow, religions inevitably get co-opted by transactional adolescents and narcissist children, people who pervert the religious principles for their own personal gain. Every human religion succumbs to this failure of moral frailty at some point. No matter how beautiful and pure its doctrines, it ultimately becomes a human institution, and all human institutions eventually become corrupted.

The Einstein example is important because it shows how our assumption of what is constant and stable in the universe can be wrong, and those incorrect assumptions can have massive implications on how we experience the world. We assume that space and time are universal constants because that explains how we perceive the world. But it turns out that they are not universal constants; they are variables to some other, inscrutable, nonobvious constant. And that changes everything.
